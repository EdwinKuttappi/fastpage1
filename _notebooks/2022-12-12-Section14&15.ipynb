    "# (1) Reflection\n",
    "Thorough notes(shown above) or summary that reflects understanding of today's lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's notes were all about Libraries and Variables. When talking about Libraries, API's were mentioned, which we have had some experience with already, and they are very useful in the Computer Science Field. They can help you a lot when you are trying to code something. API's are very useful for using, finding, and collecting pre-determined data. Another part of the lesson that was mentioned was about Documentation which is basically text that explains the logistics behind your code. It's like justifying your work in Math, you basically use Documentation to ensure you and other programmers know what your code is for, and if you need help on it, people can easily understand your intentions. There is nothing wrong with adding a lot of information with your code, it might not be necessary, but not adding enough documentation can cause problems for other programmers and yourself. If you look back on a segment of code you made a while ago, you might read the documentation and think the code has a different purpose than it originally had. Randomization was also mentioned, and this is useful especially in lists and algorithms that rely on things of chance like a coin flip or rolling a dice, these are examples of random occurrences. I have learned that randomization is used a lot in Python because it is so important in lists, and many games and websites actually use it.\n",

    "# (2) Multiple Choice\n",
    "1. What does the random(a,b) function generate? \n",
    "\n",
    "A. A random integer from a to be exclusive\n",
    "\n",
    "B. A random integer from a to b inclusive. \n",
    "\n",
    "C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer: B\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: This is because that you want to make sure that you include a and b within the randomized list, you can not exclude it because it is a range that includes it. This means that it can't be exclusive. Next, we know that a and b are integers and that they are the index of a list that are connected to a list, so since it is a range, it will only work for integers in a list, also since we are using random, that is why a random integer from a to b is being chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. x = start, y = stop, z = step\n",
    "\n",
    "B. x = start, y = step, z = stop\n",
    "\n",
    "C. x = stop, y = start, z = step \n",
    "\n",
    "D. x = step, y = start, z = stop\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer: A\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: In this function, the parameters are start, stop, and step. First, off I know that x has to be start, and this is because it is a range, and you want to start off with the beginning of the list, and then y has to be stop because it has to know when to stop. This tells the range to stop, and the list will stop there, and this means that z has to be the step, which tells the code what the increment of the values should be. Step should go last because the code needs to know the range of the list before the step.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which of the following is NOT part of the random library?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. random.item\n",
    "\n",
    "B. random.random\n",
    "\n",
    "C. random.shuffle\n",
    "\n",
    "D. random.randint\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer: A\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: I have seen random.randint be used before especially in pseudocode and also in the examples and practice problems that we did for this lesson, it just generates a random integer. Additionally, I have also seen random.shuffle used during this lesson to simulate random chances like a number generator or flipping a coin. Then, random.random is a thing, and all it does is generate a float between 0 and 1. Item() is it's own parameter and does not need to be randomized and it can just act as it's own. This means that random.item is not an actual thing, so my answer is Option A."

    "1. What is the advantage of using libraries? \n",
    "Libraries are so beneficial, and in fact I have been told this by many people. One of my good friends, Raunak, who likes to program a lot says that he uses API's, which are libraries with a lot of information, and he uses them frequently because it is so easy. I have heard from so many different people that using API's is a very easy method for making sure that we can use it and display code very easily. Another example of this is when Kris, a panelist, came to our school and talked about how Twitter used REST API until about 2 years ago. API's are convenient as well because they provide procedures and pre-written code to maximize the efficiency of programmers.\n",
