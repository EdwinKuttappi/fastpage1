<p>We were assigned a 50 Question Multiple Choice Test in preparation for the AP Exam and we know what to expect on that day. When I got to class on Friday, two of my groupmates had already finished it, and I knew I had to work on it over the long weekend The questions were not too hard, but we spent a lot of time collaborating and explaining our answers to make sure the other one got it. I did this pretty quickly and finished quicker than expected and when I submitted I got a 45/50 (90.0%).</p>

<h1 id="test-corrections">
<a class="anchor" href="#test-corrections" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Test Corrections</h1>
<p>After I submitted the test, I got a 43/50 (86%), which was around what I thought I would get. I was hoping to get an A, but I guess this means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpage1/images/tri2midterm.png" alt=""></p>

<p>1.A: 3/3 (100.0%)</p>

<p>1.D: 9/10 (90.0%)</p>

<p>2.A: 6/7 (85.7%)</p>

<p>2.B: 4/5 (80.0%)</p>

<p>3.A: 1/1 (100.0%)</p>

<p>3.B: 2/2 (100.0%)</p>

<p>3.C 0/1 (0.0%)</p>

<p>4.B: 18/19 (94.7%)</p>

<p>4.C: 2/2 (100.0%)</p>

<p>I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don’t understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right.</p>

<h2 id="question-17">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-17" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 17</h2>
<p><strong>Topic 3.6, 3.7, and 3.9</strong>: Conditionals, Nested Conditionals, and Developing Algorithms</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Wrong Answer: A and B, I chose this because I was not sure what exactly the code was trying to say and what exactly we need to do, but I kenw thatI had to find the options that would result in the correct conditionals.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Correct Answer: A and D, these were the correct answers because they used the conditionals and made sure the output was true with the two statements.</p>

<h2 id="question-22">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-22" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 22</h2>
<p><strong>Topic 3.8</strong>: Iteration</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Wrong Answer: A, I said that only algorithm 1 would work because I understood what that was trying to do, but for the second algorithm, I didn’t understand hwo giving values to someone else would calculate the average height.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Correct Answer: C, Both Algorithms are able to find the correct answer and they are able to calculate the correct average, I just didn’t know what Algorithm B did and was not really sure how it worked.</p>

<h2 id="question-27">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-27" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 27</h2>
<p><strong>Topic 3.8</strong>: Iteration</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Wrong Answer: C, I knew that n had to be set to the value of 1, but I did not understand how the loops repeated n times worked and was really confused, it was similar to the one question with the loops value and the answer was 3y.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Correct Answer: D, this was the correct answer because we shouldn’t set the value of n before the loop iterates n times, and setting the variable n and adding 1 should only be at the end of the code.</p>

<h2 id="question-38">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-38" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 38</h2>
<p><strong>Topic 3.12</strong>: Calling Procedures</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Wrong Answer: A, If the initial value of number is 4, the REPEAT UNTIL loop will reduce the value of number to 2, and then to 0, at which point the loop will terminate. The procedure will return true, not false.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Correct Answer: C, The REPEAT UNTIL statement subtracts 2 from the parameter number until the condition number ≤ 0 is true. After this REPEAT loop ends, the value of number is either 0 (if the original number was even) or –1 (if the original number was odd).</p>

<h2 id="question-50">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-50" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 50</h2>
<p><strong>Topic 2.1</strong>: Binary Numbers</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Wrong Answer: A, I just completely guessed on this problem because I had no idea how to do this and I did not really remember how to use the hexadecimal to find the character.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Correct Answer: C, this is a hexadecimal and it is asking for the number 56 with base 16, so we have to do 5(16) + 6 = 86 which is the Character V.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#confusing-problems" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Confusing Problems</h1>

<h2 id="question-2">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 2</h2>
<p><img src="/fastpage1/images/midtermquestion2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I did not understand the purpose of the program and I had to try and guess what could be changed in order to find out the answer. On this question, I had to guess the answer because I did not know what would make sure the output of the code would stay the same.</p>

<h2 id="question-16">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-16" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 16</h2>
<p><img src="/fastpage1/images/midtermquestion16.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This question was a complete guess because I had no idea what each one meant completely, I had an idea of each one, but I wasn’t sure why the answer was selection, I knew it couldn’t be iteration because that would help with the even number, and I had to guess between the other three choices, and I was right. I still do not understand but maybe I can understand by looking at someone else’s test corrections.</p>

<h2 id="question-30">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-30" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 30</h2>
<p><img src="/fastpage1/images/midtermquestion30.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This question was very hard and I did not reallt understand what the question was asking and I had no idea what I had to do. I got this question right but I did not know why it was B and C, all I knew was that it was not A or D because the circles did not line up.</p>

<h1 id="reflection-on-the-exam">
<a class="anchor" href="#reflection-on-the-exam" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflection on the Exam</h1>
<p>Overall, the test was pretty easy and I am happy with ny score, but I should try to get a higher score. If I paid attention a little more, I think I could have understood the questions a bit more I think I went through this test pretty slowly because I did not really understand each question and I had to read it a lot of times. I think I can do well on the AP Exam if I find out what exactly I need to do and keep reviewing the content, spend less time on each problem.</p>
