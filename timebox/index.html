One thing that we also have to do is make a domain for our group and host subdomains for each of our sites but it did not really work well and took some time to finish. I added submenu for my CollegeBoard Notes and Quizzes so that makes it easy for people to switch between each one and try and find different ones.</td>

This API was interesting because I could ask it a question like what color are apples and it would say yellow or green or red. This week we also had to correct an error with Burger and Fries and make sure we knew how to use elif statements and string variables like k and v but I did not really do this.</td>

We focused on the CollegeBoard Big Idea 4.1 Notes about the Internet to learn how exactly information can be sent from one place to another place as well as the process of that. This week was mainly just deploying our flask site on a common machine for all of Mr. Mortensen's APCSP classes and make a subdomain called agenda.nighthawkcodescrums.gq.</td>
