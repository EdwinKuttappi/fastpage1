<p>This past week, we had to write two poems in my class, one was finding words from a poem and making one from that, and then we had to make two new poems with our words.</p>

<p>The other poem was to write an actual poem using your own words</p>

<p>An Immigrant Coincidence
I came to America in hope for this promised life
Once I arrived everything was out of sight
Treated like an outstander with a lowlife
I applied for a job but had to put up a fight</p>

<p>They directed me towards the department of agriculture
With no friends, I sought a subculture
Found myself surrounded by those with a similar incidence
I don’t think this was a coincidence</p>

<p>I feel I have found my place
Where everyone is alike with the same mission
The relationship between us is like a baseball team trying to go to base
Crowds of people all with a comforting smile, I finally feel recognition</p>

<p>Though this country may have a bell that rings liberty
It reminds me of the taste of bitter tea
So I say this country is only as good as it’s people</p>

<p>Shielded from the Warfare
I thought this new world would be a place to call home
But I have no freedom to roam
At the park, I saw a bald eagle
An American Symbol, yet making me feel illegal</p>

<p>I thought this country would be full of opportunities
Hoping to make use of all the amenities
Despite the uninviting feeling
It does feel a little freewheeling</p>

<p>I thought this country would make me smaller
Yet every day I feel more like a scholar
The education here is like none other
It feels great to not have to suffer</p>

<p>I thought this country wouldn’t care
All of this to get away from warfare
When I got here, all I could think of was being free
The thought of getting a college degree</p>

<p>I thought this country would provide me with a shield
And it has helped me become healed
I am still discovering my capability
Overjoyed with all the possibilities</p>
