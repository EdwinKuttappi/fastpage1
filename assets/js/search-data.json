Using a While Loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Using a Recursive Loop . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

I tried to change the minima but it resulted in an error message . This was the error message I got when I changed the theme to something else, in this case, I did minimal instead of minima . In the above image we see that everything worked except the Jekyll build because it did not recognize that and it was not able to deploy it on the website so the actual appearance of the fastpage did not change . After choosing a theme, I decided to choose slate and afterwards I realized my website did not work. The style was completely different and I liked it but one issue I found was that when I clicked on a post, I couldn’t click the title to go back to the page and the home page was completely different and the posts’ format was different as well .",

            "title": "Thoughts on the Alumni Panel",
            "content": "AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A Alumni Panel . On August 29th, 2022, 6 AP Computer Science Alumni that graduated Del Norte came from their colleges to talk to the students taking the class right now. . I attended the panel for 3 reasons; 1, I obviously wanted the extra credit; 2. I knew one of the panelists and wanted to see her thoughts; 3. I wanted to learn more about Computer Science and their experiences . The Beginning of the Panel . In the beginning of the panel was when everyone introduced themselves and what college they went to and what major they were doing. . When Colin said that he was a Mechanical Engineer at UCSD, I started listening closely to him because I wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer and I wanted to go to UCSD. 🤓🔧🎓 . Questions asked during the Panel . In the First Question, I learned that Computer Science is a very important skill and this really helps people in their daily lives. Nitya said that computer science really helps you to develop skills that are really important in other parts of your life. One example of this is that computer science can be frustrating and there can be so many errors that you have to learn to fix. Problem Solving is a huge skill that really helps in so many different areas. On top of this, when trying to solve problems you may go to others and find a solution together helping you to develop social skills which are also very useful. . Allison said that AP Computer Science Principles has really helped her with learning to develop websites which has gotten her many internships and helped her to get a lot of volunteering time. . Nitya also said that when she took the class during the pandemic, her and her group worked together to make a database about COVID-19 statistics and she realized that coding can be used to really help people around the world. This reminds me of a person I know who made websites for small businesses during the pandemic, and his web development skills are nice . Challenges faced during the class . When asked a question about challenges they had to overcome, a common answer was trying to understand all the programming content in the beginning weeks because they had to solve a lot of problems and had a lot of errors. Many of them felt that it was hard at the beginning even though some of them had prior experience, they still faced a lot of problems with their code. . Another Problem was that they were comparing themselves to others a lot and making themselves feel bad because they didn’t get an Internship at Google. Anthony even said that one of the not so great things you could do was look at other people’s linkedin profiles and seeing how many qualifications they have. . As mentioned before, coding can help in so many different areas and is an important skill to learn. I learned from the panelists that coding can really help in a high-level math class and Jupyter Notebooks helps in some classes as well. . Internships and Volunteering . In the beginning of the class, Mr. Mortensen mentioned that many students can get an internship from APCSP or APCSA and many have chosen that path. I know that Nitya did an internship with a professor at UCSD and now she studies at UCSD majoring in Computer Science. I also learned that many of the panelists did internships with their school. I also learned that the internships from major companies usually open up in September or in November, which really helps me because I want an internship. You can also even get an internship from an IT school which would be really helpful for experience. A popular company for internships seemed to be Northrup Grumman and they usually only take 20 students from PUSD. It is also really helpful to have a lot of linkedin friends or your friend’s parents for an internship at their work if you want to because referrals make it a lot easier to get an Internship. High School Internees can usually find one at a small company. . I also learned that Computer Science has helped with volunteer hours as I mentioned earlier as some people built websites for people such as Allison. She said that she volunteered at a church and helped build a website for them. . My Takeaways . ONE major takeaway I learned was that coding was a really important skill and is used all the time in different jobs and majors. Colin, who I was listening to because he was a mechanical engineer at UCSD, which is what I wanted to do, said that during his build projects he codes a script. This has made me want to practice coding way more because in the future if I can solve problems faster as a mechanical engineer than others, I have a higher chance of getting hired. . I was happy to hear that as a Mechanical Engineer at UCSD, Colin had to do a hands-on project as a freshman and in his senior year, he has to do another hands-on project. He said he used coding to help him speed up the build process .",

Computer Science is a really important skill and is very useful in your daily life even if you don’t want to major in Computer Science, the class teaches you skills in other majors such as Problem Solving . Allison said that web development was a really important skill that she learned that she uses very frequently and Computer Science Principles really helped her develop that skill . This class has helped many people such as Nitya to realize that Computer Science can be used in the real world. . A Big Challenge for Computer Scientists was starting and getting a lot of people saying how they were so good at Computer Science and this makes you feel like you need to compare yourself to them. . As a Mechanical Engineer at UCSD, you have to do a hands-on project freshman year and another hands-on project senior year, and you have to make the most of it. Computer Science was a class that helped the alumni to develop skills such as social skills and help them to understand how you learn the best. . The Mechanical Engineer at UCSD has used so much information from Computer Science for his major. Coding is everywhere and is really helpful for some projects and can help save a lot of time. Coding can help a lot in high-level math classes and Jupyter Notebooks are really helpful in some activities in College . Computer Science Principles and Computer Science A is really helpful to help you get internships at Colleges. I know Nitya got an internship at UCSD for Computer Science and this really helped her with her transition to UCSD. Code Ninjas is also a job with Computer Science that can help you a lot, Additionally, you can learn a lot from internships at IT schools. Allison helped a church group and did graphic design. Nitya did an internship at Northrup Grumman, but they only usually take 20 students from PUSD. . Colin who is a mechanical engineer at UCSD was able to use programming during his education at UCSD to help him solve problems. These problems would take too long without code, so coding has really helped him with building things. . This September and November are when most major companies start hiring for summer internships, and you need a resume, Smaller Companies usually take High School Student Internees. Ask some of your friends’ parents for an internship at a company. .",

The other poem was to write an actual poem using your own words . I would like to share both poems, but the second one is not done, so I will share it once it is done . The First Poem .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
