            "content": "Objectives: . Students will be able to... . Understand the concept of data structures, including lists, dictionaries, and 2D arrays | Learn how to iterate through data structures using loops | Able to visualize data structures and iteration processes | Able to apply their knowledge to build simulations/interactions using lists and iteration | Learn how to store list and dictionary content in databases | . Lesson 1: Lists and Iteration . Lists (Ethan) . Lists are a type of data structure that can store multiple items in a single variable | Lists are defined using square brackets [ ] | Each item in a list is separated by a comma | Lists are indexed, starting at 0 | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;] print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;] . Accessing Lists . To access individual items in a list, we use the index of the item. | Python uses zero-based indexing, which means the first item in the list has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, and so on. | . print(fruits[0]) print(fruits[2]) . apple orange . Slicing Lists . We can also extract a specific portion of a list using slicing. | We use the colon : operator to specify a range of indices to include. | . print(fruits[0:2]) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;] . Modifying List Items . Lists are mutable, meaning that we can change the value of an item in a list. | To change the value of an item in a list, we can use the indexing operator (square brackets) to access the item and then assign a new value to it. | . fruits[2] = &quot;pear&quot; print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;] . Adding and Removing List Items . Adding . Use the append() method to add an item to the end of a list. | . fruits.append(&quot;kiwi&quot;) # Adds &#39;kiwi&#39; to the end of the list print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Use the insert() method to add an item to a specific index in a list. | . fruits.insert(1, &quot;peach&quot;) # Inserts &quot;peach&quot; at index 1 print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;peach&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;pear&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Removing . Use the remove() method to remove the first occurrence of an item from a list. | . fruits.remove(&#39;pear&#39;) # Removes the first occurrence of &#39;pear&#39; print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;peach&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Use the pop() method to remove the item at a specific index from a list. | . fruits.pop(2) # Removes the item at index 2 print(fruits) . [&#39;apple&#39;, &#39;peach&#39;, &#39;grape&#39;, &#39;kiwi&#39;] . Use the clear() method to remove all items from a list. | . fruits.clear() # Removes all items from the list print(fruits) . [] . Function Explanation . InsertToList . This function is designed to insert a new item into a list at a specific index. | It first retrieves the new item to be added and the index at which to add it from the HTML document. | It checks if the retrieved values are both valid integers and if the index is within the range of the list. | If the values are valid, the function uses the splice() method to insert the new item into the list at the specified index. | In JavaScript, the splice() method modifies an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements. | The splice() method takes three arguments:the index at which to start changing the list, the number of elements to remove, and the new item to add. - The item is inserted without removing any elements, so we pass 0 as the second argument. | Finally, the function calls the visualizeList() function to display the updated list on the web page. | . // Get the value of the new item and the index where it should be inserted function insertToList() { let newItem = parseInt(document.getElementById(&quot;newItem&quot;).value); let index = parseInt(document.getElementById(&quot;index&quot;).value); if (!isNaN(newItem) &amp;&amp; !isNaN(index) &amp;&amp; index &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; index &lt;= myList.length) { // splice() method to insert the new item into the list myList.splice(index - 1, 0, newItem); // Call the visualizeList() function to update the display of the list visualizeList(); } } . SortList . In JavaScript, sort() is a built-in method used to sort the elements of an array in place. The default sort order is ascending, but you can also specify a descending sort order. | In this case, the function sorts myList in ascending order based on their numerical value. | . // Sort myList array in ascending order function sortList() { // The function a - b is used, which subtracts the second element b from the first element a. // If the result is negative, a is sorted before b. If the result is positive, b is sorted before a. If the result is zero, the order of the elements is unchanged. myList.sort((a, b) =&gt; a - b); visualizeList(); } . Applications of Lists . Data processing: Lists are commonly used to store and process large amounts of data. In data analysis and machine learning, lists are often used to store datasets. . | Gaming: Lists are used extensively in game development to store game objects, player statistics, and game maps. . | Finance: Lists are used in finance to store and process financial data, such as stock prices and market trends. The data from these lists can also be used to calculate financial metrics and to create financial models. . | . Hacks (0.3) . Make your own list and manipulate it via accessing specific elements, adding or removing elements, etc. | Extra: Make an interactable visualization that can manipulate elements in a list such as the one demonstrated in our flask repository | . Iteration (Alex) . What is iteration? . In programming, iteration refers to the process of repeating a set of instructions until a specific condition is met. This can be achieved using loop structures like for loops and while loops. | . For Loops . A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g. a list, tuple, string, etc.) and execute a set of statements for each item in the sequence. Here&#39;s the basic syntax of a for loop in Python: | . sequence = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] for variable in sequence: print(variable) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . my_string = &quot;Hello, World!&quot; for character in my_string: print(character) . H e l l o , W o r l d ! . While Loops A while loop is used to repeat a set of statements as long as a condition is true. Here&#39;s the basic syntax of a while loop in Python: . num = 0 while num &lt; 5: print(num) num += 1 . 0 1 2 3 4 . Applications of Iteration . Iteration is a fundamental concept in computer programming and is used in a variety of real-life applications. Here are some examples:Data Processing . Data processing often involves iterating over large datasets to perform specific operations on each element. For example, in a data analysis task, you might iterate over a list of numbers to compute the average, or iterate over a list of strings to find the longest string. | . User Interfaces . User interfaces often involve iteration to display and handle data from various sources. For example, in a web application, you might iterate over a list of users to display their information in a table. Similarly, in a desktop application, you might iterate over a list of files to display them in a file explorer. | . Machine Learning . Machine learning algorithms often involve iterative processes to train models and improve their accuracy. For example, in a gradient descent algorithm, you might iterate over a set of training data to update the model&#39;s parameters and minimize the loss function. | . Popcorn hack (0.3) . Make a list related to your CPT project Shown in Code Below | . | Make a while loop that will print each term in the list Shown in Code Below | . | Make a for loop that will print each term in the list Shown in Code Below | . | . Simulation mechanics . In Python, pop() is a method that is used to remove and return an element from a list. The syntax for using pop() is as follows: | . phones = [&quot;Galaxy S23&quot;, &quot;Galaxy S23 Plus&quot;, &quot;Galaxy S23 Ultra&quot;, &quot;Pixel 7&quot;, &quot;Pixel 7 Pro&quot;, &quot;iPhone 14&quot;, &quot;iPhone 14 Plus&quot;, &quot;iPhone 14 Pro&quot;, &quot;iPhone 14 Pro Max&quot;, &quot;Wing&quot;, &quot;ZFlip 4&quot;, &quot;Razr&quot;] # List Related to CPT Project is about smartphones print(phones) for smartphone_model in phones: print(smartphone_model) while smartphone_model == &quot;Pixel 7&quot;: print(&quot;WOW, COOL PHONE&quot;) else: print(10) .

Average stats for LeBron James: PPG: 21.00 RPG: 11.00 APG: 5.00 P+R+A: 37.00 . NumPy impacts the given code because it performs operations on arrays efficiently. Specifically, it converts a Pandas DataFrame object to a NumPy array object, and then calculates the average statistics for a the player you guys inputted. Without NumPy, it would be more difficult and less efficient to perform these calculations on large data sets. It does the math for us. .

In this example code, we first import the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We then load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function. We print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame using the df.head() function. Next, we calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using the appropriate Pandas methods, and print the results. And, we create a histogram of the &#39;MPG&#39; column using Matplotlib by calling the plt.hist() function and setting appropriate axis labels and a title. We then call the plt.show() method to display the plot. Even though NumPy is not directly used in this code, it is an important underlying component of the pandas and Matplotlib libraries, which are used to load, manipulate and visualize data. It allows them to work more efficiently . Lesson Portion 5; Summary . Summary/Goals of Lesson: . One of our goals was to make you understand data analysis and how it can be important in optimizing business performance. We also wanted to make sure you understood the use of Pandas and NumPy libraries in data analysis, with a focus on NumPy. As someone who works with data, we find Pandas incredibly useful for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python. The way we use pandas is to calculate individual player and team statistics. We are a group that works with numerical data, so NumPy is one of our favorite tools for working with arrays and applying mathematical functions to them. It is very fast at computing and manipulating arrays making it a very valuable tool for tracking statistics which is important to our group. For example, if you have an array of the points scored by each player in a game, you can use NumPy to calculate the total points scored, average points per player, or the highest and lowest scoring players. .

            "content": "Taking the Multiple Choice Test . We were assigned a 50 Question Multiple Choice Test in preparation for the AP Exam and we know what to expect on that day. This was assigned on a Friday, but we had until the next Monday to finish it. Many of my groupmates had started it and I worked with some of them to get maybe the first 15 questions done, but I had to I did this pretty quickly and finished quicker than expected and when I submitted I got a 61/66 (92.4%). . Test Corrections . After I submitted the test, I got 61/66 (92%), and I was surprised that I only got five problems wrong, most of the questions were easy but I did not know how to answer them some of them, especially ones that were about Big Idea 4. I did get an A, but I should also work on improving those other concepts. This means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills. . . 1.A: 0/1 (0.0%) . 1.B: 1/1 (100.0%) . 1.C: 2/2 (100.0%) . 1.D: 12/13 (92.3%) . 2.B: 11/11 (100.0%) . 3.A: 1/1 (100.0%) . 3.B: 4/4 (100.0%) . 3.C: 3/4 (75.0%) . 4.B: 6/6 (100.0%) . 4.C: 4/4 (100.0%) . 5.A: 3/3 (100.0%) . 5.C: 3/4 (75.0%) . 5.D: 1/1 (100.0%) . 5.E: 3/4 (75.0%) . I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don’t understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right. . Question 14 . Topic 3.9: Developing Algorithms . Explanation for Wrong Answer: A, The programs display different values. . Explanation for Correct Answer: C, The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11. . . Question 46 . Topic 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Explanation for Wrong Answer: A, It is not possible to create an algorithm to solve an undecidable problem for all programs and inputs. . Explanation for Correct Answer: D, An undecidable problem is one in which no algorithm can be constructed that always leads to a correct yes-or-no answer. . . Question 47 . Topic 5.6: Safe Computing . Explanation for Wrong Answer: B, The sender’s private key cannot be used to decrypt the message. . Explanation for Correct Answer: D, In public cryptography, a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key and decrypted with the recipient’s private key. . . Question 60 . Topic 3.13: Developing Procedure .

Explanation for Correct Answer: B and C, Cloud computing fosters new ways to communicate and collaborate, allowing users to share files and tools easily. Cloud computing sites must consider security concerns in order to protect their users’ private data. . . Confusing Problems . Question 2 . . I did not understand the purpose of the program and I had to try and guess what could be changed in order to find out the answer. On this question, I had to guess the answer because I did not know what would make sure the output of the code would stay the same. . Question 16 . . This question was a complete guess because I had no idea what each one meant completely, I had an idea of each one, but I wasn’t sure why the answer was selection, I knew it couldn’t be iteration because that would help with the even number, and I had to guess between the other three choices, and I was right. I still do not understand but maybe I can understand by looking at someone else’s test corrections. . Question 30 . . This question was very hard and I did not really understand what the question was asking and I had no idea what I had to do. I got this question right but I did not know why it was B and C, all I knew was that it was not A or D because the circles did not line up. . Reflection on the Exam . Overall, the test was pretty easy and I am happy with ny score, but I should try to get a higher score. If I paid attention a little more, I think I could have understood the questions a bit more I think I went through this test pretty slowly because I did not really understand each question and I had to read it a lot of times. I think I can do well on the AP Exam if I find out what exactly I need to do and keep reviewing the content, spend less time on each problem. .",

            "content": "Taking the Multiple Choice Test . We were assigned a 50 Question Multiple Choice Test in preparation for the AP Exam and we know what to expect on that day. This was assigned on a Friday, but we had until the next Monday to finish it. Many of my groupmates had started it and I worked with some of them to get maybe the first 15 questions done, but I had to I did this pretty quickly and finished quicker than expected and when I submitted I got a 46/50 (92.0%). . Test Corrections . After I submitted the test, I got a 43/50 (86%), and I was surprised that I only got seven problems wrong, most of the questions were easy but I did not know how to answer them some of them. I did get an B, but I should also work on improving those other concepts. This means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills. . . 1.A: 1/3 (33.3%) . 1.D: 8/10 (80.0%) . 2.A: 1/1 (100.0%) . 2.B: 7/8 (87.5%) . 3.B: 2/2 (100.0%) . 3.C: 5/5 (100.0%) . 4.B: 2/2 (100.0%) . 5.A: 5/6 (83.3%) . 5.B: 9/10 (90.0%) . 5.D: 3/3 (100.0%) . I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don’t understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right. . Question 1 . Topic 4.3: Parallel and Distributed Computing . Explanation for Wrong Answer: B, this option is incorrect. Statement III is also correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users. . Explanation for Correct Answer: C, this option is correct. Statement I is correct because the Creative Commons license is designed to increase the amount of content available to the public for free. Statement III is correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users. . . Question 9 . Topic 4.1: The Internet . Explanation for Wrong Answer: B, The user’s browser makes a request for the file, and the file is broken into packets by the server for transmission. The user’s browser does not request each packet in order. . Explanation for Correct Answer: A, Digital data on the Internet is sent by breaking data into blocks of bits called packets. The packets are reassembled by the user’s computer. . . Question 23 . Topic 2.3: Extracting Information from Data . Explanation for Wrong Answer: D, Suggestions for other products to purchase based on viewed items is a useful pattern for an online retailer to find. A collection of all the products their customers are viewing is a large data set. . Explanation for Correct Answer: C, By current standards, a single high school’s list of student grades is not considered a large set of data. Furthermore, identifying 10 students with the highest grade point averages is not an example of finding patterns. . . Question 27 . Topic 2.2: Data Compression . Explanation for Wrong Answer: D, By copying pixels from one part of the image to another part of the image, the old RGB values of the pixels have been lost. . Explanation for Correct Answer: C, If a negative of the original image is made, each RGB triplet value will be computed by subtracting the original value from 255. The original value can then be restored by subtracting the new value from 255. This process is lossless because the exact original can be restored. . . Question 34 . Topic 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Explanation for Wrong Answer: A, This statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the problem is undecidable. If it could be shown that an algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer for all other instances of this problem, then this problem would be decidable. . Explanation for Correct Answer: B, A decidable problem is one for which an algorithm can be constructed to produce a correct output for all inputs. If, for one instance of the problem, this is not possible, then this problem cannot be decidable. Therefore, it must be undecidable. . . Question 38 . Topic 3.16: Simulations . Explanation for Wrong Answer: A, Simulations facilitate the formation and refinement of hypotheses. By varying the input data to the simulation, the operation of the train can be tested under a variety of circumstances. . Explanation for Correct Answer: D, Simulations are most useful when real-world events are impractical for experiments. Discovering and correcting potential safety issues using a simulation before the train route is constructed is much safer and less expensive than discovering them after the train route has been constructed. . . Question 42 . Topic 3.14: Libraries . Explanation for Wrong Answer: C, Determining whether two text files have the same exact content is not useful when attempting to determine whether a word appears in two text files. . Explanation for Correct Answer: B, correct. Two calls to this procedure can be used to determine if a particular word appears in each of two text files. If both calls return true, then the word appears in both text files. . . Confusing Problems . Question 2 . . I did not understand the purpose of the program and I had to try and guess what could be changed in order to find out the answer. On this question, I had to guess the answer because I did not know what would make sure the output of the code would stay the same. . Question 16 . . This question was a complete guess because I had no idea what each one meant completely, I had an idea of each one, but I wasn’t sure why the answer was selection, I knew it couldn’t be iteration because that would help with the even number, and I had to guess between the other three choices, and I was right. I still do not understand but maybe I can understand by looking at someone else’s test corrections. . Question 30 . . This question was very hard and I did not really understand what the question was asking and I had no idea what I had to do. I got this question right but I did not know why it was B and C, all I knew was that it was not A or D because the circles did not line up. . Reflection on the Exam . Overall, the test was pretty easy and I am happy with ny score, but I should try to get a higher score.

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a ___. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is ___. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # prints out each unique number only once # does not print out the extra 2 or 1 # no duplicates # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # it involves storing data using some data structure (dictionary, list, etc.) # Hashmaps/hashtables are also another kind of data structure . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary.

            "title": "CSUSM College Majors Talk",
            "content": "Background . On March 28th, 2023, some representatives came from California State University of San Marcos. I believe the purpose of these representatives were to get students interested in coming to CSUSM because of their majors. They wanted to attend a class that students were interested in that could lead to a STEM Major, this could get students interested in pursuing STEM Majors and get them interested. . Thoughts before the Panel . As a student who is in AP Computer Science, I found the talk from CSUSM to be very useful. As a junior, I have not had too many college talks except for the ones that come and visit Del Norte in the beginning of the year. A lot of students don’t talk about California State Universities because many of them end up going to Universities of California, as our school has many high-achievers. I was surprised when the speaker said she failed some courses, and still managed to get into CSUSM, which was interesting as CSUSM still accepted her. Learning that failure is not only normal but can also lead to new opportunities was one important thing I learned and remember during any struggles I have during Computer Science or other classes. . Notes . Here are some notes that I took during the . I was very surprised to see how many students from APCSP and APCSA showed up today, I guess they all wanted the extra credit and wanted to learn more about the CSU System. I know that I personally wanted to learn more about the CSU system and find out how it compared to the UC System. . Stories . The representatives mentioned that they failed some of their classes but they did not give up, and they kept going on to pursue a STEM Major | They failed STEM specific classes such as Calculus and Physics but they kept going on | Despite failing, they were still able to obtain a PHD | CalState helped them to gain a lot of knowledge and opened a whole door of opportunities | . CSUSM Fun Facts . 18% of CSUSM is enrolled in the College of Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics | California State University of San Marcos is a newer college | They have a new Engineering Building and College | This college is a national leader in social mobility | One of my Spanish Teachers attended this university, and this is when I was first introduced to this college | . Representatives . John: A computer scientist who graduated from Cal State San Marcos | He is from Escondido | Started at Palomar College for 2 years and later transferred to Cal State San Marcos | Obtained a computer science degree | Took about 6 years to get bachelor’s degree | He believes computer science is a very versatile field to get into | . | Ashley: Also graduated from Cal State San Marcos | Works in a quantum computing group | Loves physics and pursued it in college (got physics degree) Even though she failed AP Physics in high school, she still decided to pursue it (she believes that even if you aren’t very good at something, you can still pursue it if it’s interesting and fun to you) | . | She will later try to earn a PhD for material science and engineering | . | . Pathways and Departments . CSUSM has many STEM focused pathways for students especially in Physics | The pathways of CSUSM include Chemistry | Biochemistry | Applied Physics | Electronics | Biology | Computer Science | Cybersecurity | Electrical Engineering | Mechanical Engineering | Computer Engineering | . | The departments of CSUSM include Physics | Chemistry | Biotechnology | Mathematics | Computer Science | . | .

Clubs are an important part of getting into a college | You should join many clubs that pertain to your interests and that you should participate in them as much as possible | CSUSM also has clubs available on campus Cybersecurity Club | Robotics Club | 3D Printing Club | . | Clubs that I am in are CTF Club, Robotics, Coding4Kidz, Chemistry Tutoring Club, Badminton Club, Del Norte Food Bank Club, Helping Hands, and Tech Space | It is important to be in clubs during your undergraduate years | Internships are a great way to get into college and they can really help you with your career | The worst thing someone can say when you apply is that you are not qualified enough, that is not true, and that you should apply anyways | Sometimes internships might not require a lot of knowledge where other internships may require knowledge or some courses such as Computer Science Principles | Internships are an important way to be a part of research and help you get into college | Google is a great resource for finding any internships | Internships come in all shapes and sizes, and there is one for every field, but a lot of STEM focused internships | When you are applying for internships, it is important that you know everything that is required and show why you deserve this internship and show your passions | Internships can be useful when you are trying to determine your interests and exposing yourself to experiences | One of the CSUSM representatives said they had an internship and that helped her to confirm her major of Mechanical Engineering | If looking for an internship, you should try and find one that is paid | If you get a paid internship, you are basically getting paid to pursue their interests | Interests can be found in internships | Check your emails frequently and look for opportunities | Another way to get into college is by finding scholarships | Many scholarships are offered to students, and you can receive a lot of money | CSUSM has many programs such as the Summer Scholars Program which allows you to do research with a professor | CSUSUM also has Quantam, which is a $1500 scholarship and it allows you to learn quantum science | Scholarships can help to decrease your student debt which many people have | College Debt is a very real thing, and the representatives still have some to pay off | There are two types of loans Subsidized Loan: This is a loan partially funded by the government, these loans are usually loans for undergraduate students with financial need | Subsidized loans don’t accumulate interest while you are in school at least half-time or during deferment periods | Unsubsidized Loan: An unsubsidized loan are both undergraduate and graduate students. Unlike subsidized loans, they are not based on financial need, also, the government doesn’t pay interest for this type of loan. | Since they are partially funded by the government, if you had to take a loan because you are not financially able to go to college, it’s best to take a subsidized loan | . | . Toothbrush Demo . One thing that was interesting about this panel was the interactive demo that we did with the toothbrush which I thought was interesting and I really liked it. It made me feel a little bit like a kid again, because I don’t really get to do these kinds of things anymore. I felt just like an engineer talking to other students about how this worked and why it worked. . First we used a battery to start vibrations to the toothbrush head and make it move as well as spin around in a circle . Next we had to use wires and connect the battery to the wires and then put electrical tape over the wires and battery to connect them . A couple of my old groupmates, Sachit and Colin, and even my new groupmates like James were working on this in a group, and one of them finished and it was so cool to see . Here is a video of a robot that we got working and what it was supposed to look like . Takeaways and Reflection . After listening to this panel, I have found myself becoming more and more excited about Computer Science and other STEM majors. I found that it is very important to learn from your experiences and try to become better by working hard. I also learned that even if you failed some classes, you can still work hard and go to CSUSM because you can learn more and work harder. I also learned that Mechanical Engineering was a prominent major that many people took at CSUSM, which was interesting because I want to become a Mechanical Engineer, and I thought that not many people actually chose that major. I talked with the person afterwards about Mechanical Engineer and I was told that there are so many different things she does, and knowing how to code was one of them, she says that Computer Science unlocks so many different skills, and is a big part of trying to understand Mechanical Engineering, and the language she uses the most is Python. To connect this to today’s event, Ashley mentioned that she is working towards getting a PHD, which is impressive and that she is working hard to obtain it, and this resided with me because I want to major in Mechanical Engineering. . Insights . Everything that Ashley said was what I resided with the most because she was someone who took on Mechanical Engineering even after she failed. She said that she took a paid internship which confirmed her interests of becoming a Mechanical Engineer. This was interesting because she failed AP Physics and might have been discouraged after that, but she still went on and worked hard towards that goal. Now she is earning her PHD which was inspiring. I want to become a Mechanical Engineer when I grow up, and I am also taking AP Physics next year, many of my friends have a hard time with that class, and I am a little scared, but knowing how she failed this class but is still going on brings a little comfort to me. She also said that try and get a paid internship rather than an unpaid one because you are getting paid to pursue your interests. When I talked to her about Mechanical Engineering, I learned how important Physics and now I plan on putting a lot of time and effort into Physics next year. Another thing that she told me that as a Mechanical Engineer, they do a lot of hands-on work, and I really like to do this, and when she said this, this somewhat confirmed my want to become a Mechanical Engineer. I have also learned that it is important to be active in Computer Science, and in order to further my learning experience with Computer Science, I have been hoping to finish the online Harvard Computer Science Class. Computer Science can help one to develop skills that is necessary in many other careers with the benefit of learning how to program. Personally, I think I should continue Computer Science even after High School. I have been keeping my eye on the Harvard Computer Science Class for a while, and I think this event has inspired me to finally start it. . The hands on experiment was also really cool because it made me want to become an engineer even more, and there were many people that I think also felt the same way, and really enjoyed this experience and wanted to do more like this. I think this event was huge because of the interactive activity that we as students don’t get to do too much of anymore. .",

            "content": "CPT Plan . This is my plan for my CPT Project which is using Google Maps and letting the user choose a specific area which they can input, but I don’t really know if I want to continue this project. . Overview of Project . The name of our project is called “Playground”, and it is intended to serve as an arcade for users to provide them with an immersive, fun experience. The users will have multiple games to choose from and will even be able to view a leader board to see where they are compared to other registered users. On Thursday, we were to present our project idea to the class, but due to the time constraint of 3-5 minutes, we were not quite able to say everything that we wanted to present. This blog serves to talk about our project but in more detail, with heavy emphasis on my individual part of the project. . Team Roles . We have assigned each member of our team a page of the project for them to complete so that everybody’s CPT submission will be different but still be based on the same idea. . Sachit Prasad - Backend Developer and finding nearest airport to city . Raunak Mondal - Scrum Master and making an airport game . Colin Weis - Frontend Developer and Rating Locations . Edwin Abraham - DevOps and finding an airport and outputting a map . My Project . When we were told to do a project that we were passionate about, I said I really wanted to do Smartphones, but my other group members wanted to do something with transportation. The other three members in my group decided they wanted to do a flight theme, and I was not too passionate about. However, one thing I have always wanted to do since the beginning of APCSP was use a Google Maps API. . Finished . Got a Maps API | Got a Geocoder API | Connected the two API’s | Fixed the Maps to set on the user’s location To Do . | Fix Database | Use CRUD in my database | Find a way for user to input the CRUD | Fix Gemfile of Tri 2 Group and Tri 3 Group, but focus on Tri 3 Group | . Changes before AP Exam . Overall, even though there are several setbacks and limitations to the plan that I have, what I have so far is a great start and is definitely something that I can work with so that it can be improved or more refined. I will make sure to clear up the concerns that I have by maybe researching algorithms that go into making these kinds of games and using it as a source of inspiration (and citing it, of course). By doing this, I will feel much more confident about incorporating the algorithm into my program and modifying it so that it has more depth to it. While my part of the project is very important, my teammates also have their own projects to work on, and I will make sure that I help them if needed, as we will all need to present our parts for N@tM. In essence, I think I have a great idea for how I want my program to turn out in the end and can explain how it meets the College Board criteria to someone who may not be familiar with how the project was made, the rubric, or even both. .",

            "title": "Reflection on the Trimester 2 Final Exam",
            "content": "Taking the Multiple Choice Test . We were assigned a 25 Question Multiple Choice Test in preparation for the AP Exam and we know what to expect on that day. This was assigned on a Thursday, and I started it on the Friday afterwards, I finished 22 of the questions and then I forgot to to finish it. We had until the next Thursday to finish it. I worked with one of my groupmates, Luka, and we both collaborated on some questions. I was able to finish 22 questions, but when CollegeBoard automatically submitted it for me, my score was 20/25(80.0%). . Test Corrections . After I submitted the test, I got a 20/25 (80.0%), and I was surprised that I only got two problems wrong without counting the questions I had skipped. Most of the questions were easy but I did not know how to answer them some of them. I did get an B, but could’ve been an A if I finished. I should also work on improving those other concepts. This means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills. . . 1.D: 4/4 (100.0%) . 2.B: 4/8 (50.0%) . 5.B: 9/10 (90.0%) . 5.D: 3/3 (100.0%) . I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don’t understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right. . Question 17 . Topic 2.4: Using Programs with Data . Explanation for Wrong Answer: B, This information can be determined using the data collected, but not the way described in this option. One way to determine the method of payment that was used in the greatest number of transactions during the 7-day period is to sort the data by the method of payment as described. Instead of adding the number of items purchased for each type of payment, a count of each payment type needs to be computed. If the counts are stored in a new field, then the counts can be sorted to find the method of payment used in the greatest number of transactions. . Explanation for Correct Answer: D, For each transaction, the data includes the date of the transaction and the number of items purchased in the transaction. By searching the data to find all transactions that occurred on the given date, and then adding the number of items purchased in each of those transactions, the total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined. . . Question 21 . Topic 2.4: Using Programs with Data . Explanation for Wrong Answer: B and C, Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Sorting by year will sort the remaining entries in column C from least to greatest, putting the photograph with the lowest year value in the first row of the spreadsheet. This sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1. . Explanation for Correct Answer: B and D, Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Sorting by year will sort the remaining entries in column C from least to greatest, putting the photograph with the lowest year value in the first row of the spreadsheet. Sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet. . . Question 23 . Topic 2.4: Using Programs with Data . Explanation for Wrong Answer: N/A, To be counted, a show must be a talk show that airs on Saturday or Sunday. Therefore, the AND operator should be used instead of the first OR operator. To be counted, a show must be a talk show that is on Saturday or Sunday. Therefore, the AND operator should be used instead of the first OR operator. In addition, it is not possible for day to be equal to both “Saturday” and “Sunday”, so the AND operator should be an OR operator. It is not possible for day to be equal to both “Saturday” and “Sunday”, so the second AND operator should be an OR operator. . Explanation for Correct Answer: B, For a show to be counted, the value of genre must be “talk” and the value of day must be “Saturday” or “Sunday”. . Question 24 . Topic 2.1: Binary Numbers . Explanation for Wrong Answer: N/A, I did not answer this question because I forgot to finish the quiz and the quiz automatically submitted for me. If I did answer this question, I am pretty sure that I would have got it right because I can just change the binary number into decimal, and then add one, and find the binary number of that. . Explanation for Correct Answer: A, the answer should be 1001 0100 because the ID of the previous student is 1001 0011 which converts to 147, and then we add one because that is the ID of the next student, so that is 148. The binary number of 148 is 1001 0100, and this is what Option A is. . Question 25 . Topic 2.1: Binary Numbers . Explanation for Wrong Answer: N/A, Appending three 0s to a decimal number multiplies it by 1,000. Appending three 0s to the end of a binary number multiplies it by 23. Incorrect. Appending three 0s to the end of a binary number multiplies it by 23, not by 4. Appending three 0s to the end of a binary number multiplies it by 23, not by 3. . Explanation for Correct Answer: C, Appending a 0 to the end of a binary number multiplies the number by 2. Therefore, appending three 0s to the end of a binary number multiples the number by 2 three times, which is the same as multiplying the number by 8. . . Confusing Problems . Question 2 . . I did not understand the purpose of the program and I had to try and guess what could be changed in order to find out the answer. On this question, I had to guess the answer because I did not know what would make sure the output of the code would stay the same. . Question 16 . . This question was a complete guess because I had no idea what each one meant completely, I had an idea of each one, but I wasn’t sure why the answer was selection, I knew it couldn’t be iteration because that would help with the even number, and I had to guess between the other three choices, and I was right. I still do not understand but maybe I can understand by looking at someone else’s test corrections. . Question 30 . . This question was very hard and I did not reallt understand what the question was asking and I had no idea what I had to do. I got this question right but I did not know why it was B and C, all I knew was that it was not A or D because the circles did not line up. . Reflection on the Exam . Overall, the test was pretty easy and I am happy with ny score, but I should try to get a higher score. If I paid attention a little more, I think I could have understood the questions a bit more I think I went through this test pretty slowly because I did not really understand each question and I had to read it a lot of times. I think I can do well on the AP Exam if I find out what exactly I need to do and keep reviewing the content, spend less time on each problem. .",

Explore SQLite Connect object to establish database connection- Explore SQLite Cursor Object to fetch data from a table within a database | . Schema of Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema? . - A database schema is a column of a table of data, or also known as a category such as name, uid, password, or dob. . What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? The purpose of an identity Column in a SQL database is to help us know what the rest of the column is about, what kinds of data types it will contain, and any other relevant information. | . | What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database? A primary key is something that is used to identify someone. The primary key (i.e. id) should be unique to each user so that it is easy to tell who is who. | . | What are the Data Types in SQL table? There are many data types such as integers, structures like lists and dictionaries, strings, floats, and probably more | . | . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/sqlite.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;users&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() .

Reading Users table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL SELECT statement to read data . What is a connection object? After you google it, what do you think it does? A connection object represents a unique session with a data source. In the code cell above, the connection objection would be the line called conn = sqlite3.connect(database), so it would be the conn variable | . | Same for cursor object? A cursor object is . An example here would be when a breakpoint is set when the variable results is defined, we can see the cursor when we debug in VSCode | . | Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? For the conn object, I see that some of its attributes include in_transaction, isolation_level, and row_factory. For the cursor object, I see that some of its attributes include arraysize, lastrowid, row_factory, and rowcount. | . | Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? Yes, &quot;results&quot; is an object because it not only appears under the the list of local variables, but it also includes data used as a part of the functionality of the program. It includes the attributes of each user, such as their name, their uid, and their date of birth. | . | . import sqlite3 def read(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Execute a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table results = cursor.execute(&#39;SELECT * FROM users&#39;).fetchall() # Print the results if len(results) == 0: print(&quot;Table is empty&quot;) else: for row in results: print(row) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() read() . Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compare create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? The create() function in the Object Oriented Programming was called on an object | The imperative version involves creating numerous variables within the function rather than the objects | Both of these have their own pros and cons. The imperative version is less error prone, but also less efficient | The converse is true for the create() in the OOP version. Imperative version does not censor your password | Using OOP might be easier if one is trying to work with large amounts of data. If one is trying to work with a small amount of data, imperative might work better. | . | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? The purpose of the SQL INSERT statement in this code is to insert a new row of data into the &quot;users&quot; table of a SQLite database | The INSERT INTO statement specifies the name of the table and the columns where the data should be inserted, and the VALUES clause provides the values to be inserted into those columns | The ? placeholders are used to prevent SQL injection attacks by sanitizing user input | The INSERT INTO statement in this code is similar to the init method of a User class in that both are used to create a new record or object in the database | However, there are some differences. The INSERT INTO statement only inserts data into a table in the database, while the init method of a User class creates a new instance of a class in memory | . | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() #create() . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? The &quot;hacked&quot; part in the code is meant to provide a password that meets the minimum length requirement (2 characters) for security purposes. The message variable is set to &quot;hacked&quot; in this case to indicate that the password was automatically set, so that way no one can look at the code and find out what the password is | . | Explain try/except, when would except occur? The try/except block is used to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the SQL command | In this case, the try block contains the SQL command to update the password for the specified user, and the except block catches any sqlite3 | Error exceptions that might be raised during the execution of the command. If an exception occurs, the code inside the except block is executed | It is similar to an if/else statement | . | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? The code that connects to the database and creates a cursor object is repeated in each of these examples. This is because it is necessary to establish a connection to the database in order to execute SQL commands. The cursor object is used to execute the SQL commands and interact with the database | Once the SQL commands have been executed, the cursor and connection objects need to be closed to free up resources and prevent memory leaks. | . | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ? WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (password, uid)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: print(f&quot;The row with user id {uid} the password has been {message}&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the UPDATE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() update() . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? DELETE can be a dangerous operation if used carelessly as it permanently removes data from the database, and if it is used with caution, it can result in unintended data loss or corruption | . | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? The &quot;f&quot; before the string is used for f-strings, which are a way of formatting strings that allows you to include the values of variables directly in the string | The curly braces {} surrounding uid indicate that the value of the uid variable should be inserted at that position in the string. This provides a much easier alternative than .format() | . | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() delete() . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? The menu repeats so that if the user would like to perform multiple operations in one sitting (create and red for example), they can do so. They can perform as many operations as they would like until they don&#39;t input anything or make the program exit. | . | Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? Yes, it is possible to refactor this with a list, and you can probably by using list comprehension in Python. | . | . def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete or (S)chema&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif operation.lower() == &#39;s&#39;: schema() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) .

By looking at CollegeBoard&#39;s procedural abstraction definition, but it refers to the concept of breaking down a program into a set of code blocks or functions that perform specific tasks | These procedures or functions can be called from various parts of the program as needed, without the calling code having to know the internal details of how the function works. | Procedural abstraction can be used in this implementation, as there are separate functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user records in the database. The menu function acts as a controller that allows the user to choose which operation they want to perform | For example, in the create() function, it prompts the user to enter the required details, connects to the database, creates a cursor object, executes an SQL command to insert the data into the database, and then closes the cursor and connection objects. This entire process occurs by calling the create() function | Overall, since there are multiple functions with specific tasks included in this implementation, there is definitely procedural abstraction being used here | . | [x] In 2.4a or 2.4b lecture Do you see data abstraction? Complement this with Debugging example. Recalling the College Board criteria, data abstraction is essentially representing something (i.e a program) in a much more simplified, condensed method while hiding its more internal functions | Looking at this implementation, I do see data abstraction in this implementation. The implementation hides the details of the underlying database operations from the user, providing a simple interface for performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations | Regarding debugging, one possible example is if the user enters invalid input (e.g., a non-existent uid when updating or deleting a user). An example would be the implementation catches the exception raised by the database operation and prints an error message to the user | The error message provides a high-level explanation of the problem (&quot;No uid was found in the table&quot;), without revealing the underlying implementation details. This is an example of data abstraction, as the implementation is hiding the details of the database operation (in this case, the SQL query) from the user and providing a simplified, high-level interface for working with the data. | . | . | .

Machine Learning . From Tutorials Point%20is,a%20consistence%20interface%20in%20Python). Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

After I submitted the test, I got a 46/50 (92%), and I was surprised that I only got four problems wrong, most of the questions were easy but I did not know how to answer them some of them. I did get an A, but I should also work on improving those other concepts. This means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills. . . 1.A: 4/4 (100.0%) . 1.D: 1/2 (50.0%) . 2.A: 4/4 (100.0%) . 2.B: 8/9 (88.9%) . 3.A: 2/2 (100.0%) . 3.C: 1/1 (100.0%) . 4.A: 1/1 (100.0%) . 4.B: 7/7 (100.0%) . 4.C: 4/5 (80.0%) . 5.C: 5/5 (100.0%) . 5.D: 4/4 (100.0%) . 5.E: 5/6 (83.3%) . I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don’t understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right. . Question 13 . Topic 5.5: Legal and Ethical Concerns . Explanation for Wrong Answer: A, this option is incorrect. Statement III is also correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users. . Explanation for Correct Answer: C, this option is correct. Statement I is correct because the Creative Commons license is designed to increase the amount of content available to the public for free. Statement III is correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users. . . Question 23 . Topic 1.4: Identifying and Correcting Errors . Explanation for Wrong Answer: C, this option is incorrect. Compression techniques are not used in the addition of numbers. . Explanation for Correct Answer: A, this option is correct. The binary representations (in 3 bits) of 5 and 3 are 101 and 011, respectively. If these numbers are added, the result would be 1000. Since only 3 bits are used to represent integers in this example, the result would be stored as 000. This is an example of overflow error. . . Question 35 . Topic 3.7: Nested Conditionals . Explanation for Wrong Answer: B, this option is correct. The binary representations (in 3 bits) of 5 and 3 are 101 and 011, respectively. If these numbers are added, the result would be 1000. Since only 3 bits are used to represent integers in this example, the result would be stored as 000. This is an example of overflow error. . Explanation for Correct Answer: A, correct. If scoreA is greater than both scoreB and scoreC (the first two IF clauses), then Team A wins. If scoreA is greater than scoreB but not greater than scoreC, then scoreC is greater than both scoreA and scoreB and Team C wins. If scoreB is greater than scoreA (the outer ELSE clause) and scoreC (the IF clause in the outer ELSE), then Team B wins. If scoreB is greater than scoreA but not greater than scoreC, then scoreC is greater than both scoreA and scoreB and Team C wins. . . Question 50 . Topic 3.17: Algorithmic Efficiency . Explanation for Wrong Answer: B and D, incorrect. As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at an exponential rate, as the number of steps is equal to 2n for a list of size n. This indicates that the algorithm does not run in a reasonable amount of time. . Explanation for Correct Answer: A and D, correct. As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at a linear rate, as the number of steps is equal to 10n for a list of size n. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time.The number of steps for this algorithm is equal to the length of the list squared, as the number of steps is equal to n2 for a list of size n. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time. . Confusing Problems . Question 2 . . I did not understand the purpose of the program and I had to try and guess what could be changed in order to find out the answer. On this question, I had to guess the answer because I did not know what would make sure the output of the code would stay the same. . Question 16 . . This question was a complete guess because I had no idea what each one meant completely, I had an idea of each one, but I wasn’t sure why the answer was selection, I knew it couldn’t be iteration because that would help with the even number, and I had to guess between the other three choices, and I was right. I still do not understand but maybe I can understand by looking at someone else’s test corrections. . Question 30 . . This question was very hard and I did not reallt understand what the question was asking and I had no idea what I had to do. I got this question right but I did not know why it was B and C, all I knew was that it was not A or D because the circles did not line up. . Reflection on the Exam . Overall, the test was pretty easy and I am happy with ny score, but I should try to get a higher score. If I paid attention a little more, I think I could have understood the questions a bit more I think I went through this test pretty slowly because I did not really understand each question and I had to read it a lot of times. I think I can do well on the AP Exam if I find out what exactly I need to do and keep reviewing the content, spend less time on each problem. .",

            "title": "Guide to Week 24 Hacks and CPT Feature",
            "content": "My Feature . I decided to try doing a feature with Google Maps, in fact this was something I wanted to do last trimester, but there was too much to learn I decided to put it off as a personal project. I did not make any progress, but then for this trimester, it was suggested that I make my feature surrounded by Google Maps API. . Google Maps API was really difficult to use, but there were a lot of resources around it. It was still difficult to obtain an API and I spent a majority of my time figuring how it would work. I turned to RapidAPI because I was running low on time and I found MapsTiles, where I was able to make a program where the user could input coordinates and then it would show a map. I contacted MapsTiles regarding credit, but they also gave me a suggestion to use Geocoding in order to make it easier for the user, but this kind of broke my code and I was not able to implement it . Purpose and Function . Purpose: In order to help users plan their trip better accordingly to the trip that they have. They will be able to use the map and see what is next to the airport and find activities, restaurants, or even hotels . Function: The function of this program is that users will input an airport and then a Geocoding API will convert that into coordinates and then the coordinates will be used to output a map . Goals . Make a visually appealing website and make the UI of my feature look nice and friendly for others to use | Make a program that allows a user to find the total distance between two airports | Show users a path between the two airports that can show them their route if they take that flight | To make sure the backend is constantly updated with any things that are inputted in the frontend and then shown using the database | Have a database that will display the trip of the person with their first location, second location, and the total distance | Implement create, read, update, and delete options into my feature | . Challenges . Obtaining a API key for Google Maps API | Getting started with SQLAlchemy and sqlite.db | Getting Data to show and be formatted correctly on our site | Trouble getting the data from the textboxes into the API in order to output the map - My Computer broke during Week 19, so I couldn’t do the assignment and this assignment turned out to be pretty important part of our final project, but I had no idea how to use sqlite.db, so the fact that my computer had broke really made things harder for me and I could not really figure out how to make a database, so I had to look at many other people’s files and find out how it worked, this took a majority of break, and I couldn’t finish it before school started | . Setbacks . Originally, I wanted to make a calendar to show the flights that people could take, but that was going to be harder to implement | I also wanted the users to be able to delete their inputs from the database | I could not figure out how exactly how to allow the users to update their inputs into the database | I wanted the users to be able to input two airports so the distance between the two could be found easily, this was going to be hard because the API that did support this cost money, so I decided to keep that option for later and try and find another API on RapidAPI | I wanted to use Google Maps API, but I was so unfamiliar with their software and how to use it that I decided to just use RapidAPI instead and find an API that worked similarly to Google Maps API, but was easier to implement | . POST and GET . A POST method is used to submit a new coordinate to the database. “Data” is the variable that is used to represent the list of coordinates that later is used to output a map. . List . My list would probably be the API and it has a list of many airports and locations which the user can input. Data is the data of the locations that the program fetches from our database using a GET request - the data is represented by JSON. This data is used to make the maps with many other locations near by to it. . Two Calls . The variable that represents the list is an API. The api is the data of the cars that the program fetches from our database using a GET request - the data is represented by JSON. The first call makes a search within the Geocoding API and calls it to find the coordinates of a location. The Second call would be to the second API which uses MapsTiles in order to show that map after the coordinates have been received. . Results of Calls . The first result of the first call would be the coordinates of the locations that the user has inputted. . The second result of the second call would be taking the coordinates from the first call and then using that to output a map. .",

There are many containers here, and when run sudo docker ps, it might not look the exact same. Refer to the ports column and choose a port number. Take recipies_port_v1 for example, their ports are 0.0.0.0:8011-&gt;8086/tcp, :::8011-&gt;8086/tc Look at the left hand number of each container and find one that is NOT being used by another container. Please make sure to add your port number to this spreadsheet to avoid future confusion. To double-check, I advise that you look at the spreadsheet and see if your port number is being used. . Step 2: Updating Port Number through VSCode . Open your group&#39;s flask on VSCode, and find docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile . Within docker-compose.yml, you should probably change the image to whatever you want. It should look like flask_port_v1 but you must change it. Your new image name may look like flask_insert-name_v1 or even groupflask_v1. Refer to the spreadsheet to make sure your image is different than others, and while your at it, make sure to add your image under the images column. The next thing to consider is the actual ports section: This is what docker-compose.yml should look like with the exception of the name of your image and the left hand number under ports . version: &#39;3&#39; services: web: image: flask_projectone_v1 build: . ports: - &quot;8011:8086&quot; # 8011 would be your port and 8086 being the internal port volumes: - ./volumes:/volumes - ./instance:/instance restart: unless-stopped . . Within Dockerfile, you should be able to find ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=&quot;--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086&quot; and EXPOSE 8086. 8086 will be the port number that is on the right, if you wish you can change this to 8080 or another number, but keeping it 8086 is recommended for simplicity This is what Dockerfile should look like unless you decided to change the port number . FROM docker.io/python:3.10 WORKDIR / # [Install python and pip] RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade -y &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip git COPY . / RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt RUN pip install gunicorn ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=&quot;--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086&quot; # Can change 8086 to another number such as 8080 if desired EXPOSE 8086 # If changing internal port number in line above, this number must also match that CMD [ &quot;gunicorn&quot;, &quot;main:app&quot; ] . Step 3: Testing Step 1 and 2 . This step is just testing to see if our container is up and the steps in the past were done correctly. . In VSCode open up a new terminal | Type sudo docker-compose up | sudo docker-compose up [+] Running 1/0 ⠿ Container flask-web-1 Created 0.0s Attaching to flask-web-1 # instead of flask-web-1 it should be yours flask-web-1 | [2023-02-20 18:55:57 +0000] [1] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 20.1.0 flask-web-1 | [2023-02-20 18:55:57 +0000] [1] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8080 (1) # This port number will be your port number for the container . If this does not work then seek help or try doing step 1 and 2 and making sure your ports are fine | . Localhost In this step, if the terminal says that it has been built, go to a new browser and type localhost:xxxx. The numbers after localhost: should be your port number for the flask, the number on the left. . For example if my ports are 8091:8086, I would type localhost:8091 . Before Deployment on AWS, please make sure to check the spreadsheet to see if your ports are the same as someone else’s | . Step 4: Deploying onto AWS . Now we have made it to the AWS Part of Deployment, this is where we will get the site hosted on your own custom domain using Freenom or DuckDNS . PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE COMMITTED YOUR CHANGES TO THE FILES IN VSCODE, AND A REMINDER TO PULL FROM GITHUB BEFORE PUSHING YOUR CHANGES cd ~ sudo docker-compose ls # should see list of other projects . git clone github.com/{username}/{repository name}.git Cloning into &#39;Flask&#39;... remote: Enumerating objects: 699, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (699/699), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (429/429), done. remote: Total 699 (delta 330), reused 597 (delta 230), pack-reused 0 Receiving objects: 100% (699/699), 12.57 MiB | 10.64 MiB/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (330/330), done. cd ~/{repository name} docker-compose up -d --build . Step 5: Test Curl . To test that the application is working on AWS we can use the curl command to make sure that our code can be pulled from our flask and where we can verify the port . curl localhost: 8091 # should be localhost:-, where - is your port number . Step 6: Obtain DNS Domain . There are two ways one can obtain a DNS, the reason you can’t host your site on the IP Address, because only one site at a time can be hosted . We can use Freenom, which was what we used last trimester, but due to some difficulty obtaining a domain, Jeffrey has proposed an alternate solution, DuckDNS, which is easy to use as all you need is a Github account. Please refer to Jeffrey&#39;s Guide",

            "title": "Night at the Museum",
            "content": "Background . Our Night at the Museum was on February 16th, 2023, at 6:00pm-7:30pm. I had to take a 30 minute shift with the rest of my group and help explain our group project. We are in Period 4 with Mr. Yeung so we had to come during 6:30pm-7:00pm. Each student in our group brought their laptops to do some final changes and to display their feature, so that way we could present to more people easier. Our Project was a flight planner and we used a frontend and a backend for it. Our backend was where we had to store our data for everyone’s features and then we had to show it on our frontend, and in order to get the data from the backend, we had to use fetch commands to get the data to show and save our data used in each of the features. This trimester, I was the DevOps, which was harder than expected, many people had a problem with Freenom, so as an alternative, Jeffrey proposed using DuckDNS. I finally got the site deployed and then helped other people who needed it. . Presenting our Flask Site . Backend We did not really present our backend site, the main purpose of the site was to have it run and use it as a place to store the data that the frontend had. In order to use the backend, we had to get off the School Wifi because it had the firewall which blocked AWS which was the host we used for the backend. We quickly went over this site if there were any people who wanted to know more about our project and how we did it, so we showed them our code in the backend and how we made our own API, and how we formatted the data using Blueprint. . Presenting our Fastpage Site . Frontend This was the site we used mainly for our users to interact with. If you go to the website you can use our project and see what exactly what the users do. You can also go on the website to try it out. We got a lot of people to try out our features, and one person that I remember was an adult who came and asked us to explain our project as quick as possible. We all tried going over our feature quickly, and when we were done he just asked us questions, and it seemed like he knew what he was talking about, so I assume he had a lot of experience. I had a lot of fun explaining our project to other people. . Looking at other Projects . After 7:00, we could go, but I came early around 6:10 and looked at some projects from CSA and CSP. After 7:00, Sachit and I went around and looked at the other classes that were displaying projects for the Night at the Museum. We first looked at other computer science projects and used them, but after that we went to other classes such as Ceramics, 3D Animation, Drawing and Painting, and AP Studio Art. . Regarding AP Computer Science I looked at many projects even from Computer Science A. I liked to see how all the students in AP Computer Science A were working as well as their thought process. I took a picture of two people’s projects, Rohan Mallipeddi (APCSA) and William Wu (APCSA). . Jonathan and his group’s project was mainly about exercising and helping a person to count their calories. I found their project very cool, I mainly saw Paaras’s feature, and his calculator was pretty nice and it worked as well. . William and his group’s project was really interesting and they had a lot of work done. They did a project about crimes with multiple pieces of information attached to it. I really liked their site and they had so many features and a lot of pages. I think they did a lot of work and really showed they knew what they were doing. I listened to them present it and I was very impressed because they had so much information. . Rohan and his group’s project was amazing because it was related to Physics and it was not working, but then they fixed something using inspect element to debug it, and then it worked. There were a lot of calculations that went into it, and it looked really good. I was curious as to how it worked and what the code behind it was. . After a couple of computer science projects, we went into the room next to A151, which was full of 3D Animation pieces, so Sachit and I took some photos of the work. When we went inside of the 3D Animation Room, there was videos of other students work made into one video. Mr. Askegreen said we could not take photos of 3D Animation work, so I did not upload any photos of that here. When I took the class, the projects were the same, but the final renders looked much more better and people added things to it. . We wanted to go to the other classes, especially AP Studio Art. This was the class we spent the most time in after Computer Science. We were amazed at all the drawings and how real some of them were. We visited Drawing and Painting as well, which was not a class I went into in the last trimester’s Night at the Museum. When we were looking at the art, we met another Computer Science Principles Student who was amazed at all the art . After this we looked a bit at Ceramics, and there was a lot of interesting things we saw. One of them was an octopus which I thought had a good shape and the colors on it seemed very good. . One thing we also did on our way to the art classrooms was listen to some jazz music performed by some students. Here is a picture of Sachit in front of the Jazz Music. There is also another photo in the beginning of this blog post. .",

            "content": "Overview of the Discussion . This discussion was similar to the one that we had last week and this was just talking about Legal and Ethical Concerns as well as Safe Computing. We talked about copyright and how legal methods are used to get information about people. . Section 5.5 . There are two different types of licensing, open source and closed source. Open source allows people to view, access, and download code for a program, but closed source does not allow others to access a project or code of a project, and keep the code for themselves. . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. | I saw two different tyoes of licensing from Github, Creative Commons License, MIT licensing, and GPL License. These licenses are what makes sure that people can get credited for their work and make sure they know when their work is distributed. The creative commons license doesn’t allow copyrighting and is given out for public use. MIT License is a closed source however, and it can be distributed but the owner should get credit for their work. Then in the Open Source GPL License, this one allows the owner to change the project except distribute closed sources. However, a MIT License might also work because it can help because it can allow others to use code, but the author is still credited. . In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. | I think that it is important for students to learn that most projects are open source because then it allows for many people to use the code and then the author is credited so others know that the code is not theirs, but is being used for educational purposes. . Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. | I personally went with an MIT license for my fastpage becuae I wanted other students to see my code and how I did something specificially. I want to be able to help students by providing my code publicly while also allowing them to credit me so that way, other people will know their code is not their’s, but used it for educational purposes. Our team decided to use MIT License as well because it is widely accepted and many people are already familiar with it and is simple to understand. Also, MIT License is allowed by our API’s and github-pages. However, I think we could have gotten away with GPLv3 Licensing because students can use our project and see how we implemented our API’s, and they can see it, but it makes sure they can’t steal our code even if they credit us. . Section 5.6 . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. | I have seen PII was when people tried to crowdsource for their projects. There were many google forms that we had to fill out for other CompSci groups so that they would be able to use that for their projects. Also on slack, when you click on someone’s profile, you can see their email. I am also seeing many projects where you have to sign up and they request an email. . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? | I do not feel super exposed in the Internet with my personal information. Whenever someone googles me, I don’t think they will actually find me because I have not done a lot in the public. I don’t have any of the famous social medias like Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. I think you can only find my github profile and possibly my email. I think that PII can be dangerous and people use it to find out who exactly you are, I use this to see if I have seen a specific person beforre. . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. | There are many examples of both good and bad passwords, but typically a bad password is something like the name of the website or your first name. Bad passwords can also be your personal info like your date of birth or name. A good password is typically something that is easy to remember, and is something that no one else knows about you. A good password consists of maybe one symbol varying lowercase and uppercase letters. The password would also be stronger if there were numbers in it. . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. | Symmetric Encryption is when only one secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt protected things. There is only one key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the content. Asymmetric Encryption uses a pair of keys, both public and private, and this helps because then information can be encrypted. I think that because asymmetric encryption uses two keys and can be more secure. . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. | An example of encryption that we used in AWS Deployment was SSL Encryption. I don’t really know what it does but it helps with the data. I think we did use SSH keys though when we were setting up our fastpages and also some RSA keys. . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. | One time I received an email from a company that I trust. I usually receive emails from this company, but one day I got an email from the “company” and because I regularly got emails from them, I didn’t look to see if that email address was trustworthy. The email told me to click on a link, but the layout of the email was very different, and I was not exactly sure if it was from the company, so I checked the email address, and it looked fake. Other techniques include telling people they owe them money and then telling them to pay, or there might be more fees. . MIT License . Copyright © 2023 Edwin .

            "content": "Overview of the Discussion . This discussion was pretty simple and was a little different that it was last week, because we had an inner circle and an outer circle. It was nice to be able to talk to different people and hear their perspectives. Afterwards, the whole class would discuss the two CollegeBoard topics, and this helped me to understand each topic. . Section 5.3 . Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write . Age Groups: Facebook and Instagram . Although Facebook and Instagram are both from the same company and are popular social media with similar purposes, Instagram is for younger people while Facebook is for older people. This makes it easier for advertisers to advertise towards a certain age group. This is good bussiness because people will use a certain app based on their age and get to interact with others online around their age, so they will tend to use that app more. . Virtual Assistants . Usually, Virtual Assistants come with a Female Voice by default, but I am pretty sure that you can change the voice of these virtual assistants. So I don’t think it is as harmful as it would be if it was only female voices because consumers can always change the voice. . Company Algorithms . Two companies that work together that I have seen are Amazon and Google. For example, I googled Professional Table Tennis Paddles, and then a few minutes later, I would open Amazon and then on the home page would show a Table Tennis Paddle. This is very easy to order from Amazon, and this might influence where I would buy a Table Tennis Paddle. . HP Laptop Facial Recognition . Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? If yes or no, justify you conclusion. | No, I do not think that the owner of this computer thought it was intentional because he might’ve just thought it was a flaw, but there is a small chance he thought it was intentional because it was working for his coworker in the not ideal lighting. . How do you think this happened? I think that this happened because this webcam is old and during testing, they did very little and focused more on recognizing facial features rather than focusing on skin color. They probably tested it in ideal conditions and just focusing on facial features, but didn’t think about facial features of people of color in unideal questions. . | Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? I believe this is harmful to both the consumers and the company, because once the consumers buy it and try out this feature they will be dissapointed and buy ohter products from other companies. People will stop being loyal to HP. This means that HP will lose some customers and the people will be sad that they are not. . | Should it be corrected? It should be corrected so that way people will be loyal to the company, because if consumers like everything else about the product, except this webcam, if this were to be corrected, then consumers might starting buying products frm them again. . | What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? In order to produce a better outcome, we should do a lot of testing with people who don’t have a lot of experience with traveling and those that do, so we can see how their interactions are different, and use that to improve on the website. . | Section 5.4 . Obtaining Data and Crowdsourcing . We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used. . API’s I have used are the Google Maps API, and a bunch of other APIs when I first started using APIs for APCSP, I did not really understand how they all worked, and I was really confused, but I still worked around it and did it. . We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub? . I have used Github to look at other people’s code and try to use that in my code. One of the biggest things I have found in Github was code for Del Norte’s Robotics Team, and I opened this up to see how exactly, their team coded a robot. . Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting? . I saw a lot of different datasets that had many different topics, and this is important because many people can use it for any ideas they have. Crowd Data might make us choose where we might want to eat or go. For example, if two Italian Restuarants are nearby to you, and you want to go to to one, you will probably choose the one with a higher rating. . Crowdsourcing in my Project . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . In our classes, we have many students, and this can really help us improve our testing because we can introduce much diversity. We will get many different ideas and will be able to find out what exactly users are looking for and start to implement them. Another idea is using all these students for help with feedback and with coding for this project. We can make our repository more open to people in our classes and ask them to add some features. We can also use Pull Requests and ask people to review the Pull Request and ask people if they think that feature will be beneficial. Another thing that we can do is make a form and ask people to fill it out with feedback about our website. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? If my group and I were able to crowdsource all of Del Norte, this would be very helpful because then we get feedback from students who have no computer science experience and we also get much more diversity in our testing. By opening it up to more people, we can get more suggestions to make our project better. . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . Some data I could capture would be how many people come to our area to check out our website. I can look at how other groups are inviting others to come by and comparing it to others. I can compare our website to those who have a website attracting much more people, and then ask myself what makes their website more appealing. .",

            "content": "Taking the Multiple Choice Test . We were assigned a 50 Question Multiple Choice Test in preparation for the AP Exam and we know what to expect on that day. When I got to class on Friday, two of my groupmates had already finished it, and I knew I had to work on it over the long weekend The questions were not too hard, but we spent a lot of time collaborating and explaining our answers to make sure the other one got it. I did this pretty quickly and finished quicker than expected and when I submitted I got a 45/50 (90.0%). . Test Corrections . After I submitted the test, I got a 43/50 (86%), which was around what I thought I would get. I was hoping to get an A, but I guess this means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills. . . 1.A: 3/3 (100.0%) . 1.D: 9/10 (90.0%) . 2.A: 6/7 (85.7%) . 2.B: 4/5 (80.0%) . 3.A: 1/1 (100.0%) . 3.B: 2/2 (100.0%) . 3.C 0/1 (0.0%) . 4.B: 18/19 (94.7%) . 4.C: 2/2 (100.0%) . I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don’t understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right. . Question 17 . Topic 3.6, 3.7, and 3.9: Conditionals, Nested Conditionals, and Developing Algorithms . Explanation for Wrong Answer: A and B, I chose this because I was not sure what exactly the code was trying to say and what exactly we need to do, but I kenw thatI had to find the options that would result in the correct conditionals. . Explanation for Correct Answer: A and D, these were the correct answers because they used the conditionals and made sure the output was true with the two statements. . . Question 22 . Topic 3.8: Iteration . Explanation for Wrong Answer: A, I said that only algorithm 1 would work because I understood what that was trying to do, but for the second algorithm, I didn’t understand hwo giving values to someone else would calculate the average height. . Explanation for Correct Answer: C, Both Algorithms are able to find the correct answer and they are able to calculate the correct average, I just didn’t know what Algorithm B did and was not really sure how it worked. . . Question 27 . Topic 3.8: Iteration . Explanation for Wrong Answer: C, I knew that n had to be set to the value of 1, but I did not understand how the loops repeated n times worked and was really confused, it was similar to the one question with the loops value and the answer was 3y. . Explanation for Correct Answer: D, this was the correct answer because we shouldn’t set the value of n before the loop iterates n times, and setting the variable n and adding 1 should only be at the end of the code. . . Question 38 . Topic 3.12: Calling Procedures . Explanation for Wrong Answer: A, If the initial value of number is 4, the REPEAT UNTIL loop will reduce the value of number to 2, and then to 0, at which point the loop will terminate. The procedure will return true, not false. . Explanation for Correct Answer: C, The REPEAT UNTIL statement subtracts 2 from the parameter number until the condition number ≤ 0 is true. After this REPEAT loop ends, the value of number is either 0 (if the original number was even) or –1 (if the original number was odd). . . Question 50 . Topic 2.1: Binary Numbers . Explanation for Wrong Answer: A, I just completely guessed on this problem because I had no idea how to do this and I did not really remember how to use the hexadecimal to find the character. . Explanation for Correct Answer: C, this is a hexadecimal and it is asking for the number 56 with base 16, so we have to do 5(16) + 6 = 86 which is the Character V. . . Confusing Problems . Question 2 . . I did not understand the purpose of the program and I had to try and guess what could be changed in order to find out the answer. On this question, I had to guess the answer because I did not know what would make sure the output of the code would stay the same. . Question 16 . . This question was a complete guess because I had no idea what each one meant completely, I had an idea of each one, but I wasn’t sure why the answer was selection, I knew it couldn’t be iteration because that would help with the even number, and I had to guess between the other three choices, and I was right. I still do not understand but maybe I can understand by looking at someone else’s test corrections. . Question 30 . . This question was very hard and I did not reallt understand what the question was asking and I had no idea what I had to do. I got this question right but I did not know why it was B and C, all I knew was that it was not A or D because the circles did not line up. . Reflection on the Exam . Overall, the test was pretty easy and I am happy with ny score, but I should try to get a higher score. If I paid attention a little more, I think I could have understood the questions a bit more I think I went through this test pretty slowly because I did not really understand each question and I had to read it a lot of times. I think I can do well on the AP Exam if I find out what exactly I need to do and keep reviewing the content, spend less time on each problem. .",

            "title": "Blog Reflection of Big Idea 5.1 and 5.2",
            "content": "Overview of the Discussion . I attended both the Discussion of Period 4 and 5, and I got a lot of ideas about both of the CollegeBoard Ideas discussed today, and I have learned a lot and received a bunch of new ideas regarding these two topics. . Section 5.1 . This section of Big Idea 5 focuses on Beneficial and Harmful effects of Computers and other devices that are used a lot such as drones or chatGPT. . 1) Come up with three of your own beneficial and corresponding harmful effects of Computing . Beneficial: . Helps people with their jobs | Helps to assist disabled people | Easy access to infomration communication across the world | . Harmful: . Cause people to use it too much and then forget to do things and that affects their performance | People may rely on it too much that they do not actually use their own infomration and don’t learn anything | Easy access to false information | . 2) Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent Conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . In today’s world there are so many things that can cause dopamine in your body, and this can directly relate to your performance, health, or condition. If a person looks at Social Media for too long, they might keep going because they are having fun and are thinking that it is making them happy. They might forget they have something to do such as homework and then this might affect their school work. Too much of scrolling here can affect their academic capabilities because they might keep going and then they forget about their homework and they have to stay up late in order to finish it and htye might not get enough sleep which can affect their health. . Section 5.2 . This Section of Big Idea 5 focuses on DIgital Divide such as when the school provides students with chromebooks . 1) How does someone empower themself in a digital world? . Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by looking at all the resources that we have access to and then we can use that to make sure we know what exactly, and someone can empower ones self by developing digital skills, managing personal information and privacy, and staying informed about technology trends. By doing this we can make a space for people and they also can make a positive online presence, being mindful of the information consumed and shared, taking advantage of online tools, and engaging in online communities similar to personal values and interests. . 2) How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. . Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by giving them inspiration or aiding them. If a person sees this, they can try to communicate with that person and ask them what is wrong so that they know what they can do. When someone is empowered they are able to share their information and they can tell other people and empowering others can be done through various actions, such as providing support, resources, education, and opportunities. One example at Del Norte could be a mentor program, where an empowered student could work with a student who is not feeling as empowered. . Canvas Questions . #1 Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit . Help people to realize where they want to travel | This can help people when they want to take a trip and our project can help them plan it as well as see some popular tourist sites | We can help increase the economy of the United States because of increased tourism (this was a big stretch) | Users can use this site to help review sites and help others when learning how to plan a trip | . #2 Think of a potential harmful effect of your project . I am not completely sure, but I think that a harmful effect could be that we are causing a lot of pollution to the environment because we are causing a lot more trips to happen, and more pollution can happen. Also another thing that happens is that we can not help users with prices and we just plan the trip, so it is not as efficient as other sites and can waste people’s time. . #3 Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? . At school, it is very annoying that we can not use our School Chromebooks because right now my chromebook is my primary device because my laptop needs to be repaired. It is very annoying that I can’t open VSCode and I still actually need to submit an ssignment from last week. Pros and Cons of this is that the admins can moderate and filter the things that we see, so that way we are not disctracted from our objectives. However, it can also prevent students from being productive. . #4 What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others . Concerns that I have about the digital divide include whether some people are peforming better because they have more access to resources and that not having access to some resources is directly correlated to their performance and marks. I know that on my Chromebook, I can’t access some resources, but other people of have access to them. Also some people don’t have phones so they might not be able to find out what is happening, and some people dont have social media so they don’t know some of the upcoming events happening. .",

Managing Complexity | 0 | 1 | There is a list called fishtypes and they explain how the list and explains how using a list is efficient, and how the code would change if no list is used | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | This person made their own procedure with two parameters, y1 and y2 to give the user some points, and they described what the procedure and how it contributes to the overall functionality and purpose of the program | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | This person talks about how they used sequencing, iteration, and selection, and they explained it enough detail that others can understand it | . Testing | 1 | 0 | There are two calls that the user is testing based on the movement of the boat, both of the calls result in outputs and they both work, and the conditions tested, and it is in enough detail that someone could make a similar thing | . Takeaways . Similar to the past few performance task scoring assignments, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. I’ve gotten used to the CollegeBoard Rubric and I think I know how to get a program that fulfills all of these programs. Knowing that actual people are grading our AP Exams, it can be determined that there can be different opinions. For example, on the first one, some people may think it deserves a 2, while some other people think it deserves a 4. This assignment just shows that the score one person thinks you got might not be your actual score, so it is important to review the rubric and try to get every single point. .",

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Testing | 1 | 1 | There are two calls included in the code of this program, and the person includes the function of each program and is able to accurately describe what it does as well as the result of each one | . Takeaways . Knowing that actual people are grading our AP Exams, it can be determined that there can be different opinions. For example, on the first one, some people may think it deserves a 2, while some other people think it deserves a 4. This assignment just shows that the score one person thinks you got might not be your actual score, so it is important to review the rubric and try to get every single point. .",

            "content": "This Group: Zeen, Shaurya, Vardaan, Navan, and Justin . HACK 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . Decidable Problems are problems that algorithms can return an output for all inputs, and an example of this can be checking to see if a number is even or odd. Undecidable Problems are problems that algorithms can not solve very simply, and they are usually algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies. . import random # Decidable Problem number = random.randint(1,10) print(&quot;The Number is&quot;, number) if number % 2 == 0: print(&quot;This is an Even Number&quot;) else: print(&quot;This is an Odd Number&quot;) . The Number is 4 This is an Even Number . import random number = 1 while number == 0: print(number) number = number + 1 if number &gt; 0: print(&quot;The value of Number is greater than 0&quot;) . The value of Number is greater than 0 . HACK 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . My Answer: C . Explanation: This is the correct choice because this answer has two integers that are being multiplied together, but then it is being squared so this will take a 3 step algorithm. It can&#39;t be none of them because option C is true, and all of the above can not be true because option B is exponential. Option C is a quadratic however. The first step would be 3 x 8, the second step is getting a value of 24, and the third step would be squaring that value. . HACK 3 . Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . function peak_finder2(array) { if(array.length) == 0: return `Array cannot be empty` else { if(array.length == 1) return array[0] } else { let mid_index = Math.floor(array.length*0.5) } if (array[mid_index +1]&gt;array[mid_index]) { return peak_finding(array.slice(mid_index + 1 )) } else if (array[mid_index -1]&gt;array[mid_index]) new = array.reverse().slice(mid_index+1).reverse() return peak_finding(new) else { return array[mid_index] } } . Cell In[43], line 1 function peak_finder2(array) ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . array = [3, 1, 4, 5, 2] function peak_finder(array) let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index = 0 if (counter === 0) if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]) peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length else: counter += 1 if (counter &gt;= peak_index) array.append(r) peak = a[1] counter = array.array else: counter += 1 peak_finder() . 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 2 checks to find 4 . I did not really understand what we were supposed to do here with this code because an array was not really provided. I was not really sure how I was supposed to implement binary search here, additionally, the code was in a lot of different places, and I was not really sure what was going on, but I knew that it was trying to sort out an array. . HACK 4 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] print(&quot;Before Sorted List:&quot;, data) print(&quot;The Length of the list is&quot;, len(data)) data.sort() print(&quot;After Sorted List:&quot;, data) . Before Sorted List: [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] The Length of the list is 10 After Sorted List: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . This Problem was pretty simple because I could just use the sort() function which made it really easy for me to do this algorithm instead of having to sort it with the other piece of code. This method saves a lot of time, and it is not as overwhelming to look at, it also is easy for other users to understand. . HACK 5 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def heap_permutation(data, n): if n == 1: print(data) return for i in range(n): heap_permutation(data, n - 1) if n % 2 == 0: data[i], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[i] else: data[0], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[0] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . I am not exactly sure why just deleting the top part of the code basically just gives us the same output. My guess is that heap_permutation is already its own parameter, so this means that it is able to shuffle all the different possibilities with the data . Extra . I want to see what else I can do with the heap_permutation parameter . small_password = [0, 1] heap_permutation(small_password, len(small_password)) password = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] # Dont want cell output too big . [0, 1] [1, 0] . dice_roll = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] heap_permutation(dice_roll, len(dice_roll)) .

            "content": "Background . Kathyleen Beveridge (Project Management) and Kris Porter (Developer Operation) and Kevin Warmerdam (Software Engineering). According to Mr, Mortensen, these two people are from Qualcomm and they are some of his old colleagues. . # Notes Notes that I took during the SD STEM Startups and Girls in CS Panel with three speakers, but one of them did not come . I was very surprised to see how many students from APCSP and APCSA showed up today . ## Kathyleen . Born in Vietnam and lived in the Bay Area and San Jose | Moved to San Diego in 2004 | She studied in Spain | Received Financial Degree from Santa Clara University in the Bay Area | Favorite Quote by Maya Angelou: “My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.” | Her first job was an investment banker but she did not like it and then she switched to tech afterwards | She learned to surf but realized surfing doesn’t pay the bills | She joined Qualcomm a couple of years ago and works now at Thermo Fisher Inc, as well as switched to High Tech | She has worked at 3 Companies for a long time which were HP, Qualcomm, and Thermo Fisher Inc (Current Employment) | Mission Statements of each of the companies are all very similar and mention wanting to help the people and make sure their lives are easier | Qualcomm chips used to be in 99% of all cellphones | She is the Senior Director of Marketing at Thermo Fisher | . Kris Porter . He took Physics and some Computer Science Classes | He went to UCLA for some classes and got his Bachelor’s Degree | His first Computer Science Class was the 2nd quarter at UCLA and was not very good at it | The first Computer Science Class he took, he was not very good at it and he kind of failed, and the 2nd time he took a Computer Science Class, he got a C, but he still moved on and learned | Was very hard for him to get a job in 2008 when the Stock Market was not in a stable condition | He worked in some Tech Areas but he wanted in the Tech Space he wanted to be in | As time went on, he slowly worked towards becoming a Development Operator | A Development Operator is someone who deploys the software and they make sure everything is secure and goes as planned | When Security is said, it is not his primary occupation to secure the network but more to look at it and see if everything goes as planned | He moved down to San Diego because his girlfriend lived here | He was looking for a new role and then found Qualcomm and was hired by Mr. Mortensen 😲 | He has worked on a bunch of different types of learning like Continuous Learning | He also used to Work at Twitter specifically at a lot of different Data Centers | Everything in Twitter used to be a REST API until 2 years ago | He works currently at a company called Mysten Labs | He has been in San Diego since 2003 | . Questions . Arushi prepared some questions . Do you have any experience in Methodology and Can You Explain it? | Kris: Different Companies have different methods of Agile Methodology. Qualcomm had a group of 150 engineers and they had many meetings that took a couple of days. THey always had a roadmap of what they were going to do . Kathyleen: Used short sprints and maybe 3 months. Agile Methodology . Kris, do you still work at Twitter? | Kris: No, I don’t work at Twitter anymore, I actually work at a company called Mysten Labs now . Mr Mortensen: Ever Since Elon Musk said he was going to buy the company, Kris knew that he needed to search for another job based on prior experiences. . What do you think is the most important skill to have? | Kris: I found the most useful overtime to be Continuous Learning and the thing is not just learning a specific programming language, but learning how to learn efficiently and grasp the most information. Don’t really be concerned and everything will fall into place. . Kathyleen: 100%, Continuous Learning as well as learn to be adaptive because of my career path, I had seen many things happen during these 35 years and it is important that you are adaptive to change. The Best Technical People I’ve worked with are people who listen to the requirements and translate it into technology. . What is the most important thing you have seen while working? | Kathyleen: . Kris: The most important thing that I have seen are interviews especially in Silicon Valley, and there is so much code . Kris: I have worked with many people that have been coding and that they want to code. I have two young kids and I want to have off hours, so sometimes I have to work overtime . What happens at Twitter? | Kris: Twitter is not the only company that does this, Meta as well. THe thing that they build internally is no where else, you can’t find it anywhere else like on Github or on the public. THe engineers built all the things at the company just by trying it. Twitter has things like nginx that is unique to it so new employees have to learn it . How do you think learning how to Code would help in Business? | Kathyleen: People are not old mannered and there is a lot of tech. I would say that if you learn how to code it is like a way of thinking and a different way of looking at problems, it is like critical thinking. Being a critical thinker can help you in interviews and become a good problem solver. . How would coding help with Investment | Kathyleen: Yes, as I mentioned earlier coding can be really beneficial to investment and can help when trading with stocks and making patterns. This also helps with critical thinking and can help with many other things in the future. . Takeaways and Reflection . After listening to this panel, I have found myself becoming more and more excited about Computer Science. Based on prior experiences and events, I have learned many times that Computer Science can help you in so many different fields. I want to become a Mechanical Engineer when I grow up, and recently Westview held a similar event with CTE Panelists, I attended and afterwards I talked with a current Mechanical Engineer. He told me that there are so many different things he does, and knowing how to code was one of them, he says that Computer Science unlocks so many different skills, for example he is currently working on an Arduino Project, which is new to him, but with his prior knowledge, it is making it a lot easier to understand how to do it. To connect this to today’s event, Kathyleen mentioned that although she works in a finance department, Computer Science has helped her to develop skills such as Critical Thinking which also led to being able to become a good Problem Solver. Additionally, Kris also mentioned that Continuous Learning was a good skill to have and that Computer Science has sort of exposed him to this way of learning allowing him to be an expert in different fields and understand different areas of work. . To conclude, this event has really taught me that Computer Science is a very important skill even if you don’t plan on taking a major with Computer Science. Even if you don’t like Computer Science, taking this class can open your eyes up to so much more new perspectives and whenever you face a problem, you can look at it in the eyes of a programmer. Computer Science can help one to develop skills that is necessary in many other careers with the benefit of learning how to program. Personally, I think I should continue Computer Science even after High School. I have been keeping my eye on the Harvard Computer Science Class for a while, and I think this event has inspired me to finally start it. .",

Software libraries contain procedures used in creating novel programs | Existing code segments can be derived from internal or external sources Libraries | Previously written code | . | Libraries simplify complex programs | APIs (application program interfaces) specify how procedures in libraries should behave | Documentation for APIs/Libraries are necessary to gain proper understanding on how to use them | We can use the code random.shuffle to help us to shuffle a list and randomize it and a library | In CollegeBoard pseudo-code RANDOM(a, b) is used to generate a random integer value in the range from a to b | In Python the random library can be imported and the min and max ranges can be set to any integer | A general way to to write this is randint(start, stop) where start is the minimum value, stop is the maximum value This can help make a coin-flip, dice roll, and anything else which needs a range | . | . Vocabulary . Documentation: Text that explains the what, how, or why of your code | Libraries: A collection of pre-written code or procedures that coders can use to maximize their efficiency | Application Programming Interface: A type of software through several computers are able to communicate information amongst each other | . (1) Reflection . Thorough notes(shown above) or summary that reflects understanding of today&#39;s lesson. . Today&#39;s notes were all about Libraries and Variables. When talking about Libraries, API&#39;s were mentioned, which we have had some experience with already, and they are very useful in the Computer Science Field. They can help you a lot when you are trying to code something. API&#39;s are very useful for using, finding, and collecting pre-determined data. Another part of the lesson that was mentioned was about Documentation which is basically text that explains the logistics behind your code. It&#39;s like justifying your work in Math, you basically use Documentation to ensure you and other programmers know what your code is for, and if you need help on it, people can easily understand your intentions. There is nothing wrong with adding a lot of information with your code, it might not be necessary, but not adding enough documentation can cause problems for other programmers and yourself. If you look back on a segment of code you made a while ago, you might read the documentation and think the code has a different purpose than it originally had. Randomization was also mentioned, and this is useful especially in lists and algorithms that rely on things of chance like a coin flip or rolling a dice, these are examples of random occurrences. I have learned that randomization is used a lot in Python because it is so important in lists, and many games and websites actually use it. . Did both notes and a summary . (2) Multiple Choice . What does the random(a,b) function generate? | A. A random integer from a to be exclusive . B. A random integer from a to b inclusive. . C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive. . D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive. . My Answer: B . Explanation: This is because that you want to make sure that you include a and b within the randomized list, you can not exclude it because it is a range that includes it. This means that it can&#39;t be exclusive. Next, we know that a and b are integers and that they are the index of a list that are connected to a list, so since it is a range, it will only work for integers in a list, also since we are using random, that is why a random integer from a to b is being chosen. . What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)? | A. x = start, y = stop, z = step . B. x = start, y = step, z = stop . C. x = stop, y = start, z = step . D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . My Answer: A . Explanation: In this function, the parameters are start, stop, and step. First, off I know that x has to be start, and this is because it is a range, and you want to start off with the beginning of the list, and then y has to be stop because it has to know when to stop. This tells the range to stop, and the list will stop there, and this means that z has to be the step, which tells the code what the increment of the values should be. Step should go last because the code needs to know the range of the list before the step. . Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? | A. random.item . B. random.random . C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . My Answer: A . Explanation: I have seen random.randint be used before especially in pseudocode and also in the examples and practice problems that we did for this lesson, it just generates a random integer. Additionally, I have also seen random.shuffle used during this lesson to simulate random chances like a number generator or flipping a coin. Then, random.random is a thing, and all it does is generate a float between 0 and 1. Item() is it&#39;s own parameter and does not need to be randomized and it can just act as it&#39;s own. This means that random.item is not an actual thing, so my answer is Option A. . (3) Short Answer Questions . What is the advantage of using libraries? Libraries are so beneficial, and in fact I have been told this by many people. One of my good friends, Raunak, who likes to program a lot says that he uses API&#39;s, which are libraries with a lot of information, and he uses them frequently because it is so easy. I have heard from so many different people that using API&#39;s is a very easy method for making sure that we can use it and display code very easily. Another example of this is when Kris, a panelist, came to our school and talked about how Twitter used REST API until about 2 years ago. API&#39;s are convenient as well because they provide procedures and pre-written code to maximize the efficiency of programmers. . | Write a thorough documentation of the following code. . | Shown in Documentation with the Code Cell with Comments Some Comments may not be able to be seen . import random # this just pulls the random library and helps the code and lists to become randomized when using the .random parameter names_string = input(&quot;Give me everybody&#39;s names, seperated by a comma.&quot;) # This will ask the user to input a name, and then this is later stored as a string names = names_string.split(&quot;,&quot;) # This defines the names variable and splits the string based on the input the user had entered in the previous code num_items = len(names) # This defines a new variable as the length of many names were entered random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1) # This will use the random library to choose a random number from 0 to the number of items-1 person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] # This takes one of the items or indexes in the user inputted list and then assigns that to this variable print(f&quot;{person_who_will_pay} is going to buy the meal today!&quot;) # This prints the last sentence saying who is going to pay the bill by using the previous randomly selected variable .

Create a program to randomly generate one of those 5x5 square CollegeBoard robot courses frequently seen in these lessons. Here are the criteria: | No need to create a graphical user interface (output the course in graphical form); that would be too demanding. You can use store your randomizations in variables to be printed, after which you can sketch one instance of your output using any means (hand drawn, google drawings, etc.) to attach to your submission as an image. . | Your illustration can differ graphically from CollegeBoard&#39;s illustrations as long as the robot, its direction, the wall squares, and the goal square are fairly self-evident (ie you can make the goal a present or food instead of a gray square) . | . You must randomize the following: . Initial direction of the robot (up, down, left, right) | Initial Position of the robot | Goal position | Positions of at least 12 wall/obstacle squares | The latter three must be mutually exclusive (on different squares). This prevents you from generating a course where the robot is on the goal, on a wall square, or the goal is in a wall square . import random direction = [&quot;north&quot;, &quot;south&quot;, &quot;west&quot;, &quot;east&quot;] itemDirection = random.choices(direction) print(f&quot;Initial direction of the robot: {itemDirection}&quot;) goalPosition = [] for i in range(1): r=random.randrange(1,10) goalPosition.append(r) . Cell In[10], line 10 goalPosition.append(r) ^ IndentationError: unexpected indent . EXTRA X 2 . Put safeguards in your program to make sure the robot course is actually possible to complete. This one is tough, so if you manage to do it you&#39;re pretty much guaranteed to get 1.0 points. This will not likely be the only way to get a perfect score, however. . &lt;/div&gt; .",

            "content": "This Group: Caleb, Qais, James, and Krishiv . Notes . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values Procedures can be referred to as method or function depending on the programing language. | A procedure call interrupts an execution of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure. | . | Arguments specify the values of the parameters | If you have a set of statements and there is a procedure, when it reaches that procedure it will execute it and then go back to the rest of the statements | If you see a return statement you automatically end the procedure even if there is more statements | If you have a set of statements in a procedure, the statement will go through the top of the procedure to the bottom in order | There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements | One common type of abstraction is procedural abstraction, which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be only knowing what it doe,not how it does it. | The subdivision of a computer program into separate subprograms called modularity | To name a procedure, it must be in all capitals meaning PROCEDURE and then the functions name should be lowercase, unless there is a part when a new word starts, so the first letter of the word should be capitalized | . Vocabulary . Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that serves a purpose | Parameter: are input values of a procedure | Modularity: the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | . 3.12 Hacks Part 1 . Skipped Question 1 . Problem 2: . Qais is writing code to calculate formulas from his math class. He&#39;s currently working on a procedure to calculate average speed, based on this formula: . Average speed= . Total Time/Total Distance ​ . Highlight which of these is the best procedure for calculating and displaying average speed. PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } | PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } | PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) } | . | . Explanation: It is the first option because we want to calculate the averages of the distances and the times, and in order to calculate the average speed, we need to do distance over time. . . Problem 3: Procedures with return values . James Hunter is looking through his classmate&#39;s program and sees a procedure called heightenEmotions: PROCEDURE heightenEmotions(myEmotion) . { moreEnergy ← CONCAT(myEmotion, &quot;!!!&quot;) . moreVolume ← UPPER(moreEnergy) . RETURN moreVolume } . That procedure manipulates strings using two built-in procedures, CONCAT for concatenating two strings together, and UPPER for converting a string to uppercase. . James Hunter then sees this line of code: . heightenEmotions(&quot;im mad&quot;) . After that line of code runs, will nothing be displayed? . True . False . Explanation: Nothing will show up because the inside is not an actual function. Even if it was defined as a function, that would only apply to the things outside of the parentheses. The parameter on the inside would not be defined and it does not really exist, but you can make it into DISPLAY(&quot;im mad&quot;) . . Problem 4: Procedures with return values . Bubz is writing a program to calculate the carbon footprint of his activities. The procedure calcFlightFootprint calculates the pounds of carbon dioxide produced per passenger in a flight that covers a given number of miles and seats a given number of passengers. . PROCEDURE calcFlightFootprint(numMiles, numPassengers) { CO2_PER_MILE ← 53.29 . carbonPerFlight ← numMiles * CO2_PER_MILE . carbonPerPassenger ← carbonPerFlight / numPassengers . RETURN carbonPerPassenger . } . Bubz wants to use that procedure to calculate the total footprint for his two upcoming flights: LA to NY: 2,451 miles and 118 passengers NY to London: 3,442 miles and 252 passengers . Which of these code snippets successfully calculates and stores her total footprint? Highlight 2 answers. . totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) + calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) . | totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118 + 3442, 252) . | | totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint((2451, 118) + (3442, 252)) . 4. laNyCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) nyLondonCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) totalFootprint ← laNyCarbon + nyLondonCarbon . Explanation: It is 1 and 3 because we can calculate the total footprint individually and then find the total by adding the two values up. Option 3 is similar to this because it runs the function in one but calculates it twice, it is like another way to write it. Option 2 does not work because it will just add them together before starting the function, and Option 4 might not work because the variables aren&#39;t being reset, I am not sure, this one was a little confusing for me to find out. . 3.12 Homework/Hacks part 2 . Practice Problem . Here is a practice problem that involves calling a procedure by having an input and an output. This is a apply discount and apply tax procedure. . $80 item receives a 20% discount and a tax is 8% . PROCEDURE applyDiscount (cost, percentDiscounted) { temp &lt;-- 100 - percentDiscounted . temp &lt;-- temp / 100 cost &lt;-- cost x temp Print(cost) . } . PROCEDURE applytax (cost, cpercentDiscounted) { temp &lt;-- 100 + percentTaxed . temp &lt;-- temp / 100 cost &lt;-- cost x temp Print(cost) . } . Explanation: I think it would be the first procedure because you should only find the price with tax after it has been discounted . Temperature Procedure . What is 80 degrees Fahrenheit in Celsius . PROCEDURE convert Fahrenheit (temperature) { . Celsius &lt;-- temperature - 32 Celsius &lt;-- Celsius x 5/9 Print (Celsius) . } . Explanation: The answer would be ~26.7 because when you plug it in Celsius is assigned to the value of 48 and then reassigned with a value of ~26.7 and then it is printed out . Problem 1 . a -- ? b -- ? c -- 9 PROCEDURE find a () { b &lt;-- 9 9 a &lt;-- b c Print (a) } What is a? cost ⟵ 173 tax - 10% PROCEDURE applytax (cost, cpercentDiscounted){ temp &lt;-- 100 + percentTaxed temp &lt;-- temp / 100 cost &lt;-- cost x temp Print(cost)} . What is the cost? . Explanation: Well since c has a value of 9 and b has a value of 81 (99), then we can find out a since it is just b c, so it becomes 81 * 9, which assigns 729 to a . Tempature - 103 Degrees PROCEDURE convert Fahrenheit (tempature) { Celsius &lt;-- tempature - 32 Celsius &lt;-- Celsius x 5/9 Print (Celsius)} . Explanation: The Answer should be 39.4 degrees celsius because we are just taking 103 and going through the function. We are subtracting 32 from 103 and then multiplying it by 5/9 to get ~39.4 . 3.13 Homework/Hacks for Part 1 and Part 2 of the lesson . Problem 1 . Create a procedure that is meant to replace the top running backs yards per game in one season if the current running back has more yards per game . Necessary Parameters: toprbyardspg(100), currentrbyards(1260), totalGames(12) | . Click for hint Refer back to 3.13 Developing Procedures Part 1 PROCEDURE CheckTopRB(currentbyyards, totalGames, topbyardspg) rbAvg = currentrbyards/totalGames if rbAvg &gt; toprbyardspg { toprbyardspg = rbAvg } print(toprbyardspg) . Problem 2 . Write a procedure that will allow the A+ to get to the 1, while avoiding the black boxes. Use what you learned about moving robots .

Problem 3 . Which Is the Correct Way to define the Name of a Procedure? . A. PROCEDURE MYLIST | B. PROCEDURE MyList | C. procedure mylist Click For Hint Remember the word procedure should be in all capitals and a part of the declared procedure should be in caps | . Explanation: B, because you want to make sure the PROCEDURE is in all caps and when defining a function it should be lowercase unless you are starting a new word, and you can&#39;t put a space, so you capitalize the first letter of the words . Problem 4 . Write A Procedure That gets the BeachBall To the Green Square . PROCEDURE moveBeachBall { ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_RIGHT() REPEAT (6): MOVE_FORWARD() ROTATE_LEFT() MOVE_FORWARD() MOVE_FORWARD() } .

            "content": "This Group: Eli, Trent, Khalid, and Samarth . 3.9 Video 1 . Notes . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks and this also means that the algorithms can appear similar yet yield different side effects or results | Some conditional statements can be written as equivalent Boolean expressions | Some Boolean expressions can be written as equivalent conditional statements | Different algorithms can be developed or used to solve the same problem | Algorithms can be created from an idea, either by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying existing algorithms | Knowledge of existing algorithms can help in constructing new ones. Some existing algorithms include Determining the maximum or minimum value of two or more numbers | Computing the sum or average of two or more numbers | Identifying if an integer is or is not evenly divisible by another integer | Determining a robot’s path through a maze | . | Using existing correct algorithms as building blocks for constructing another algorithm has benefits such as reducing development time, reduce testing, and simplifying the identification of errors | For binary search algorithms Determine the number of iterations required to find a value in a data set. | Explain the requirements necessary to complete a binary search. | . | The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of a sorted data set of numbers and eliminates half of the data; this process repeats until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated. | Data must be in sorted order to use the binary search algorithm | A binary search is often more efficient than sequential/linear search when applied to sorted data | There are two important ways to search a list | Sequential Search It doesn’t have to be in order | For a Sequential Search you compare each number to the number you are searching for | You can also use this method for strings as well | . | Binary Search While using Binary Search you have to put the group of numbers from ascending or descending order | What the computer does it takes the lowest index and the highest index, adds them and then divides that value by 2 | This gets the middle value and starts the search at the middle of the group | Go to the respective index and pull the element, if this is not the desired number then go to the left and the right to and repeat the same process for the left and the right without including the index of the middle number | To put the efficiency of the binary search method into context if you have a list of 600 numbers the maximum amount of attempts it will take to get the number is 10. (1 level of tree is one search, the algorithm goes to the side of which the number is on the tree) | This method also applies to strings as well because only the indexes are getting compared | As long as the user can put it in an order (preferably alphabetical order) to tell the algorithm which side of the middle index to go to next then it is possible to use | . | . Vocab . Iteration: Repeating steps, or instructions over and over again (this could be also often called a loop) | Selection: is a decision or question. At some point in an algorithm there may need to be a question because the algorithm has reached a step where one or more options are available | Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer. | . Lesson Practice . Here are some notes that I took during the lesson as well as the practice problems . Dice Problem . Do these two algorithms give the same results? . My Answer: No . Explanation: The code is different and it will result in different outputs for specific answers, this is because the the indents are not correct and will run multiple for specific values. Take the number 5 for example, the first algorithm will give you an output of “Nice Roll!” while the second algorithm will actually output two lines, “Nice Roll!” and “Meh… You can do better”. This is because there is nothing telling the code not to run the second line of code, because it is just if statements. . print(&quot;What did you roll on the dice?&quot;) diceRoll = int(input()) if diceRoll &gt;= 4: print(&quot;Nice roll!&quot;) else: if diceRoll &gt;= 2: print(&quot;Meh... You can do better&quot;) else: print(&quot;That was not a great roll!&quot;) . print(&quot;What did you roll on the dice?&quot;) diceRoll = int(input()) if diceRoll &gt;= 4: print(&quot;Nice roll!&quot;) if diceRoll &gt;= 2: print(&quot;Meh... You can do better&quot;) if diceRoll &lt; 2: print(&quot;That was not a great roll!&quot;) . In what instances do the algorithms yield different results for the same input? | . My Answer: When the input is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or greater if the dice has more than 6 sides . Explanation: When you plug these values the code is just doing what it is told, any number that is greater or equal to 2, will have a different output than the first algorithm. We need to find out a way in order for the algorithm to realize what we want it to do. . Why does this happen? | . Explanation: As I have mentioned earlier, this happens because the code is just doing what it is told and nothing is there that is telling the code that it can not work. In order to fix this problem, we can just add like a different domain sort of in the code, so that way if the value is greater than or equal to 2 and less than 4, it will output that line. We need to tell the code to specifically only run certain lines of codes, even if the statement is true. You can look at the code after this section to help you really understand what you really need to do. . Can we adjust the second algorithm to yield the same results? . print(&quot;What did you roll on the dice?&quot;) diceRoll = int(input()) if diceRoll &gt;= 4: print(&quot;Nice roll!&quot;) if diceRoll &gt;= 2 and diceRoll &lt; 4: print(&quot;Meh... You can do better&quot;) if diceRoll &lt; 2: print(&quot;That was not a great roll!&quot;) . Important Takeaways . Small changes/mistakes can have a big impact on the result | You need to make sure the code will work how you want it to | There is often more than one way to achieve the same result | You can add multiple if and else statements in order to make sure you get the result you want | It is very useful to put multiple if statements inside of one another | . Conditional vs Boolean . How could this conditional scenario be replaced with a boolean scenario? . | IF (isHoliday) | { school⟵false | . | } | ELSE | { IF(isWeekday) | { school⟵true | . | } | ELSE | { school⟵false | . | } | . | } | . What needs to be true and what needs to be false in order for you to go to school? . In order for school to be true, the day can not be a holiday nor can it be a weekend. If the day is a holiday, then the code will stop there and you do not need to go to school, but if it is not a holiday, then it will check and see if it is a weekday, and if it is a weekend, then there is no school, but if there it is a weekday and it is not a holiday, then there is school. . First conditional: If isHoliday is true, you do not need to go to school | Second conditional: If isWeekday is true, you do need to go to school. However, if it is false, school also becomes false | . Therefore, in pseudo code, this statement could be written as: . school⟵((NOT (isHoliday)) AND (isWeekday)) | Keep in mind that both of these statements yield the same results, and neither of them are incorrect | . More Comparing Algorithms . The algorithms below are to sum the odd numbers from 1 to 9 (1+3+5+7+9). Do they each work as intended? Yes they both do work as intended because 1+3+5+7+9 is 25, and each code segment will output 25 . sum⟵3 | counter⟵1 | REPEAT 4 TIMES | . sum⟵sum + counter | counter⟵counter + 2 - DISPLAY sum Sum: 25 | . | sum⟵0 | counter⟵9 | REPEAT UNTIL counter &lt; 1 | . sum⟵sum + counter | counter⟵counter - 2 - DISPLAY sum Sum: 25 | . | Why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks? . It is important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks because you can use them in different ways and when coding, it is important to know that your algorithm is not necessarily the correct one, but it could be the most efficient or easy to understand one. . Create an Algorithm . . Code for This Problem . REPEAT UNTIL (goalReached) | { MOVE_FORWARD () | ROTATE_RIGHT () | MOVE_FORWARD () | ROTATE_LEFT () | . | } | . Practice Question . Choose which algorithm that uses selection and/or iteration to determine the cost of one item in the store is correct . The display at the store says the following: . All Green Tag Items - 25% off All Red Tag Items - 60% off . Suppose that the tax on all items is 10% . Algorithm A: . DISPLAY (“What is the cost of the item?”) | cost←INPUT () | IF (greenTag) | { cost ← 0.75 * Cost | . | } | IF (redTag) | { cost ← 0.40 * Cost | . | } | cost ← 1.10 * cost | . Algorithm B: . DISPLAY (What is the cost of the item) | cost←INPUT () | IF (greenTag) | { cost ← 0.75 * Cost | . | } | IF (redTag) | { cost ← 1.10 * cost | . | } | cost ← 0.40 * Cost | . Another Robot Example .

Create a algorithm to move the robot to the grey square for the grid above | The robot is represented by a triangle | The robot can move into white and grey squares but cannot move into a black square . | What is wrong with the algorithm above? | How do we fix this? | By allowing it to move left | . Practice Problems . Which is a plausable way to pattern your numbers for binary search. . a. [1,4,5,2,3] b. [24,22,23,28,30] c. [5,6,7,8,2] d. [1,2,3,4,5] My Answer: d . | Explanation: When using Binary search, you want to make sure that the numbers in the list is actually in order from least to greatest, and option d is the only list that does this . How many checks would it take to print out 20 using sequential search . [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 20] 7 Checks | . | Explanation: This is because 30 is at the end of the list, and you are using sequential, so you have to inspect each item in the list, and since 20 is the 8th term, it would take 7 checks . How many checks would it take to print out 30 using binary search . [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 30] 5 Checks | . | Explanation: Binary Search starts in the middle of the list and then checks both sides, it will take 5 checks until it finds 30 since it is at the end of the list . Using Binary Search how many checks would it take to find the word kiwi. . [Apple, Banana, Kiwi, Mango, Strawberry] 1 Check | . | Explanation: If using Binary Search, Kiwi is in the middle of the list so it makes it easy to find because it will find Kiwi with one check . Rap . Each group has 2 minutes to write a 3 line rap about what they learned. One volunteer will rap their group’s lines and will receive a reward | . Our Group Rap: . Binary Search has a lot of potential, It is just essential, Way better than sequential, . Hacks . Write this Boolean statement in the form of a conditional (if/else) statement: stayInside⟵((isCold) OR (isRaining)) | print(&quot;Let&#39;s Check to see if we can go outside today&quot;) isCold = True isRaining = True stayInside = [] if (isCold or isRaining) { stayInside = True print(&quot;You Should Stay Inside!&quot;) } else { stayInside = False print(&quot;You Can Go Outside!&quot;) } . Create an algorithm that uses selection and/or iteration that will represent one player’s complete turn. . During a turn, each player gets 4 attempts/chances to get the greatest number possible. . | During each attempt, the player will use a random number generator to select a random number from 1 to 10. . | After they have had 4 chances, their score is the greatest number they received from the random number generator, and their turn is over. . | . | import random attempts = [] i = 1 while i &lt;= 4&quot; attempts.append(random.randint(1,10)) i = i + 1 print(&quot;These Are Your Numbers&quot; + attempts) print(&quot;Highest Roll:&quot; + max(attempts)) . Create an algorithm that will allow the arrow to reach the gray square: finish = false | while finish = false: if canMoveForward = true: moveForward() else: if canMoveRight = true: turnRight() moveForward() if touchingFinish = true: finish = true break() . I used a while loop so that it will keep running until it finishes and then if the robot is touching the finish line then the code will stop. It will move forward until it hits the black block and then it will turn right and move forward, until it hits the edge so it will run through the if statement again and turn right. . Make a binary search tree of different the list [1,2,3,4,6,9,11,69] | . Explain thoroughly how to find the number 69 in the list above (use key words) | We can check the number and search for 69 in the array by splitting it. You need to index the list and find the middle value of it, since the number of items in the list is even, so the middle number would be 6 which would still be less than 69. This means that we have to keep looking at the right and left side of the list. After 3 more searches, you can finally find the value 69. Otherwise you can use sequential search which would take longer because you are looking all the way at the beginning at the list and 69 is at the end. . Make a diagram explaining how you found the list (not tree, include equation) . | Put this list of strings in a order that can be used for binary search [“store”,”Market”,”Walmart”,Target”,”Ralphs”] . | search [“Market”, “Ralphs”, “store”, “Walmart”, “Target”] . You can use Binary Search for this list and then use it, I am not really sure if I did it right, but this seemed to make the most logical sense. I chose this because they are all markets, but market and ralphs are really for produce, but at target and walmart, they are more like retail stores. . Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search | Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search because it allows us to index through lists much more efficiently and it allows us to be able to find out and search for items much more quicker. Binary Search helps us to search exponentially while sequential search moves through a list one by one. Binary Search actually is able to index through half the list every single iteration, so it is much more quicker. Binary Search can save a lot of time compared to Sequential Search. . [64,36,16,11,9] Explain which number you are finding, how many check it would take, and make a binary search tree | I am going to choose to find the number 9 which is at the end of the list, but if using binary search, it should only take us two checks. I think this list should work without any reordering because it is from highest to lowest, and usually I do lowest to highest, but if doing code we should switch the &gt; to a &lt; so the code knows where to search. .",

Complete the exercises and add screenshots of your completed code to your blog Reflect on what you learned | . | Exercise 1 . This exercise was pretty simple and I just used list.reverse, but the instructions asked us to do it with iteration, so I used a for loop and made it run for every value inside the list. The code that I used here was really simple, and all I did was take the original list and then reverse it into a new list and then print that. . This is probably the right way to do it, I did this with a for loop and was able to use it to run the code and make it add it’s value for each one in the list. By using a for loop here, I was able to actually fufill the iteration requirement and able to print the reverse order. However, I am not sure if we were supposed to print each number on a separate line, but I could not figure that out. I assume we would use a for loop function and then print something like i, it would be interesting to find out how to do this, and see if I was close. . Exercise 2 . This was definitely the hardest problem or exercise that I had to do, even harder than the quiz. I couldn’t complete it so I moved to the quiz, so yeah this exercise was quite hard. I was not sure what was meant by bubble sorting. I decided to do a quick google search and this was good because after looking at it, I remembered I saw something similar in the lesson for Section 10 about Lists. . Multiple Choice Quiz . Complete the quiz and add screenshots of the questions you got wrong to your blog Reflect on what you learned | If you got everything correct, look at the javascript code used to create the quiz and explain how the use of lists and iteration helps to make the code more efficient | . | . Corrections . I got Question #10 on the quiz because I wasn’t exactly sure how many for loops we needed to use, but I knew that we needed to use a for loop because. There was 3 lists in the list, so I thought we could just use one for loop in order to iterate through. I believe that using one for loop would work but be less efficient, I think that by using 2 for loops it iterates through the lists much faster. . Reflection . I felt like I knew everything from the quiz and could answer every question. I just had a little bit of a problem with Question 10. I was not sure how many loops are exactly needed to iterate through the lists efficiently. Overall, I felt that the quiz was pretty easy and everything that was in the quiz was covered during the lesson . JavaScript Code . When I first clicked on the quiz, I was really impressed with the UI. I really liked the UI and liked that it looked so nice. I think whoever made this quiz did a really good job with the UI and made it really friendly to work with, and the other effects also impressed me. I thought that this would have taken a lot of code, but after clicking on it, I realized that was not the case. The code was way more simpler and shorter than I initially thought. I noticed that they just made a function for the questions and then used a for loop to display it making it a lot more easier than having to type out each question in each cell. The Lists and Iteration both help to simplify this code a lot, and it also makes it easier for anyone trying to understand what was going on, the code was not too overwhelming, so it was easy to understand. .

How is an if statement different from an if-else statement. . Extra words. | An if statement will only go through a process if a condition is met. An if-else statement will go through code no matter the conditions. | They are the exact same. | An if statement will go through the entire code segment every single time and the if-else statement is always used in an algorithm, no matter the conditions. | My Answer: 2 . Explanation: An if statement will only run code inside the block if it if the condition is met. However, in an if-else statement, if that statement is not true, then it will run the code in the else block, so code will be run whether the statement is true or false. 3.

If he goes to the bank, he will withdraw money only if his balance is above $1000. . If statement | If-else statement | My Answer: 2 . This is a situation where events are dependent on one event. If Ben has a full tank of car fuel, then he will go to the bank, if that statement is false, then he will go home. Once he gets to the bank, it is another if-else statement because it depends if his account has money in it. If it does not have $1000 or higher, he will not deposit money, but if he does, he will deposit money. . 4. What would be most appropriate for this situation? Luke wants to play basketball.

Explanation . What is happening in this code is that print(numbers[2]) is printing the numbers list but only the item with the value of 2, so it will output 2. Printing evens is making a math function and then if the remainder is 0 it will make a new list. Printing odds is making a math function and them if the remainder of that when divided by 2 is 1, then it makes a new list with odd numbers from the original list . Answers 1 . All the steps combined are sequencing .

Explanation . First a is set equal to b so a is 1. then b becomes the sum of c and d so b becomes 7. Then d is set equal to b so then d becomes 7 since b was redefined in the last line of code. c is never redefined so it stays the same. .

Explanation . This is because cold becomes set equal to hot, so we know both variables are equal to true. Since the variable cold has been redefined, when hot is set equal to cold, so both variables are equal to hot, so it is option 1. . Click for the answer! 1. the value of hot is true, the value of cold is true Make TWO of your own code segments that contain at least 5 defined variables, then provide the answer and EXPLAIN why your answer is correct. | Given the following code segment below: . w ⟵ boat . a ⟵ walk . t ⟵ sea . e ⟵ separate . r ⟵ cane . w ⟵ t r ⟵ e t ⟵ r .

Click for the answer! cake because a is only being changed once and it is being set to c which is cake. The output would be cake because a is only redefined once when it is set equal to c. That means that a is set to cake and when a is printed it will output cake. Sequencing | num1 = 3 num2 = 1 num3 = 5 num1 = num2 + num3 num2 = num1 + num3 # num2 is now the new num1 + num3 . What is the value of num1 and num2? . My Answers: num1 = 6 num2 = 11 . Click for the answer! num1 = 6, num2 = 11. This is because num1 is redefined as the sum of num2 and num3, so then it becomes 5+1 so num1 is equal to 6. num2 is defined as the sum of num1 and num3, but since num1 was redefined we have to use the new value.

            "title": "Reflection on the Final Exam",
            "content": "Taking the Multiple Choice Test . I wanted to take the test over the weekend, but I did not get the time too. When I got to class on Monday, two of my groupmates had already finished it, so I decided to work with Jishnu. The questions were not too hard, but we spent a lot of time collaborating and explaining our answers to make sure the other one got it. We did this until Question 20, and I finished the rest by myself. I did this pretty quickly and finished quicker than expected and when I submitted I got a 43/50. . Test Corrections . After I submitted the test, I got a 43/50 (86%), which was around what I thought I would get. I was hoping to get an A, but I guess this means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills. . 1.D: 1/2 (50.0%) . 2.B: 5/7 (71.4%) . 3.A: 7/8 (87.5%) . 3.C: 3/4 (75.0%) . 4.A: 4/6 (66.7%) . I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don’t understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right. . Question 6 . Topic 1.3: Program Design and Development . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option D Incorrect. The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so only values less than or equal to max are printed. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option B Correct. The procedure initializes count to 1. Inside the loop, the value of count is displayed, then count is incremented by 2 to the next odd integer. The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so all positive odd integers less than or equal to max are printed. . . Reflection: This question was hard and I was not really sure how to interpret the code. I was not exactly sure of the value of the variable max and I did not really know how to solve it. I remember asking Jishnu about this problem, and I had no idea how to do it. . Question 11 . Topic 1.2: Program Function and Purpose . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option D Incorrect. The inner loop iterates from index j + 1 to the end of the list, so each element is compared with all the elements that follow it, not just the one element that immediately precedes it. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option B Correct. The algorithm traverses myList using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from the first element in the list to the second-to-last element in the list. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop compares that element to every subsequent element in the array. . . Reflection: This question was also very confusing as I did not know how to do it. I was not sure how to read the code, and I am not sure what it means by subsequent and preceding. I got the wrong answer, but it seemed close to the right answer so that was good. . Question 20 . Topic 2.1: Binary Numbers . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option B Incorrect. Four bits can represent 24, or 16 pieces of information, so it is not necessary to add extra bits. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option D Correct. Four bits can represent 24, or 16 pieces of information. . . Reflection: We did not really talk about Binary Numbers in class, so I had help from Jishnu because he knew a little bit about it. For this questions, I did not know what a bit was and how it was needed to store directions. . Question 21 . Topic 2.1: Binary Numbers . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option A Incorrect. Statement II is true because colors can be encoded as sequences of bits. Statement III is true because sequences of bits can be used to represent sound. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option D Correct. All digital data is represented at the lowest level as sequences of bits. Statement I is true because strings of characters can be represented by sequences of bits. Statement II is true because colors can be encoded as sequences of bits. Statement III is true because sequences of bits can be used to represent sound. . . Reflection: Just like the last question, we did not do Binary Numbers in class so I wasn’t sure about it. I did not know you can use binary to represent strings, colors, and audio, but I think that makes sense now. . Question 36 . Topic 3.10: Lists . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option D Incorrect. This would be the correct solution if i were initialized to 0 instead of 1. This code segment will generate the list [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option C Correct. For the first iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 2, is appended to evenList, and then i is incremented to 2. For the second iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 4, is appended to the list, and then i is incremented to 3. This continues eight more times, appending the next eight even numbers to evenList. This code segment will generate the list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]. . . Reflection: I was not sure how the order matters in this question, and I am still a little confused by it, but it makes a little more sense to me now because you should define the variable before running the code with the variable. . Question 37 . Topic 3.3: Mathematical Expressions . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option A Incorrect. A temporary variable is needed to interchange the values of two variables. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option D Correct. The first statement assigns the value of num1 to the temporary variable temp. The second statement assigns the value of num2 to num1. The third statement assigns the original value of num1, which is stored in temp, to num2. The original values of num1 to num2 are interchanged. . . Reflection: The question wanted to interchange the variables so I thought that switching them would be enough, but I didn’t realize that num1 is changed to num2, so when the second line of code is ran, num2 stays the same. . Question 39 . Topic 3.2: Data Abstraction . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option C Incorrect. List indices are typically nonnegative integers, so a decimal number between two integers would be considered an invalid index. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option D Correct. List indices are typically nonnegative integers. The exam reference sheet describes a list structure whose index values are 1 through the number of elements in the list, inclusive. So, 4 would be considered a valid index. . . Reflection: I was not sure how to answer this question at all, we did not do the videos for this CollegeBoard Big Idea, but we still went over it in class, and I was not sure what a valid index was, so I guessed on this question. . Confusing Problems . These are some problems that I was not sure how to do and I needed help to understand it. I did not really understand what the question was asking or how to answer it. I just chose what I thought was the best answer, and it was correct. . Question 2 . This question was really hard and I did not really know what to do. I do not know how I got this answer correct because I had no idea what it meant by procedure or mystery. I just followed the code on the inside and chose my answer, and it turned out to be right. . Question 9 . I still do not really understand this question, but I did understand that you need to change the lines for the code to work properly. When answering this question, I did not know what to do and Jishnu said to pick number 3 and explained it to me. . Question 44 . This question was a little hard mainly because I did not know what MOD was, so I had to look it up to find out it was the remainder which was not that hard. . Reflection on the Exam . Overall, the test was pretty easy and I think I could have received a higher score if I paid attention a little more. I think I went through this test pretty quickly when I did it by myself, but when I was talking with Jishnu, that took a lot of time because he was explaining some answers to me. I think I can do well on the AP Exam if I find out what exactly I need to do and keep reviewing the content. I got a 3/3. .",

            "content": "Background . Our Night at the Museum was on November 3rd, 2022, at 6:00pm-7:30pm. I had to take a 30 minute shift with the rest of my group and help explain our group project. We are in Period 4 with Mr. Mortensen so we had We had two laptops on display so that way we could present to more people easier. Our Project was a calendar and we used a frontend and a backend for it. Our backend was where we had to store our data for the calendar and then we had to show it on our frontend, and in order to get the data from the backend, we had to use fetch commands to get the data to show and save our calendar. I was a Frontend Developer so I worked a lot on the frontend and making it look nice. . Presenting our Flask Site . Backend We did not really present our backend site, the main purpose of the site was to have it run and use it as a place to store the data that the frontend had. In order to use the backend, we had to get off the School Wifi because it had the firewall which blocked AWS which was the host we used for the backend. We quickly went over this site if there were any people who wanted to know more about our project and how we did it. . Presenting our Fastpage Site . Frontend This was the site we used mainly for our users to interact with. If you go to the website you can use our project and see what exactly what the users do. You can also go on the website to try it out. We got a lot of people to try out our calendar, and my favorite people that came were these two parents who asked us a lot about our calendar really testing our knowledge. I had a lot of fun explaining our project to other people. . Looking at other Projects . After 6:30, we could go, but I brought my sister with me and she wanted to see the art and other projects. We first looked at other computer science projects and used them, but after that we went to other classes such as Ceramics, 3D Animation, and AP Studio Art. . Regarding AP Computer Science I looked at many projects even from Computer Science A. I liked to see how all the students in AP Computer Science A were working as well as their thought process. I took a picture of two people’s projects, Jonathan Wu (APCSP) and William Wu (APCSA). . Jonathan and his group’s project was about Jeopardy but on the night of the museum, they did not really have a frontend, so he just showed me the code, but they could not really get Jeopardy to work . William and his group’s project was really interesting and they had a lot of work done. They did a project about crimes with multiple pieces of information attached to it. I really liked their site and they had so many features and a lot of pages. I think they did a lot of work and really showed they knew what they were doing. I listened to them present it and I was very impressed because they had so much information. . After a couple of computer science projects, my sister wanted to go to the other classes, especially AP Studio Art. This was the class we spent the most time in after Computer Science. I even saw an old elementary school teacher that I talked to for a bit, so that was nice. My sister really seemed to enjoy this class and told me she wanted to take it. After this we looked a bit at Ceramics but mainly looked at 3D Computer Animation after that. I pulled up my work from 2 years ago, and I was amazed how different my project was compared to everyone’s that was displayed. Mine was just the basics and what was required, but so many people went above and beyond and I was amazed by this. .",

Input In [4] &lt;!-- HTML table fragment for page --&gt; ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . This code is about HTML and it builds a table and you need the part in the beginning because it is put into a JavaScript Cell, but needs to be HTML in order to properly build the table and really show what exactly it needs to do in order to make the table. This really just sets up the code for the table so later the segments can format the data and help it ot understand what exactly is going on. . &lt; table &gt; makes a table, &lt; tr &gt; makes a row, &lt; th &gt; makes a column header, and &lt; thead &gt; is tag for the group header, and &lt; tbody &gt; is a tag used later to define an element id . &lt;!-- HTML table fragment for page --&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;All-time Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Recorded Deaths&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Active Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;time&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;total_cases&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;total_deaths&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;active_cases&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;All-time Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Recorded Deaths&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Active Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody id=&quot;result&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- generated rows --&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; . This part of the code basically just preparing the code and the table before the code actually fetches the API and outputs it as well as formats it. It is basically just a sequence. I do not know exactly what each line of code does, but I thin this whole cell is just making the headers for the table so later segments of code can reference it and use it to make a table. . &lt;!-- Script is layed out in a sequence (no function) and will execute when page is loaded --&gt; &lt;script&gt; // prepare HTML result container for new output const resultContainer = document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;); // prepare fetch options const url = &quot;https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/covid/&quot;; const headers = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;default&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;omit&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39; // &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#39;, }, }; . I think this is the base code and the main part of the program that really shows what is going on and really explains what and how the API is being formatted. First it will fetch the API, and then it will organize it into headers. Before proceeding it checks for any errors and if there are no errors then it will probably run the top part with the if statement. After that it will take the data from the API and start the organization process. This also puts data and data.world_total in the console log. It also takes each specific part of the API and chooses how to format it. It grabs specific parts of the data and this helps the code to realize where specifically the code goes in the table and what exactly to do with it. Also for each time the code makes a row depending on the data, it sends the message row to the console. The last part kind of appends some child nodes so that way it follows a specific data system and puts the information of each cell along the rows. . // fetch the API fetch(url, headers) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors if (response.status !== 200) { const errorMsg = &#39;Database response error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = errorMsg; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); return; } // valid response will have json data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); console.log(data.world_total) // World Data document.getElementById(&quot;time&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.statistic_taken_at; document.getElementById(&quot;total_cases&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.total_cases; document.getElementById(&quot;total_deaths&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.total_deaths; document.getElementById(&quot;active_cases&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.active_cases; // Country data for (const row of data.countries_stat) { console.log(row); // tr for each row const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); // td for each column const name = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const cases = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const deaths = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const active = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); // data is specific to the API name.innerHTML = row.country_name; cases.innerHTML = row.cases; deaths.innerHTML = row.deaths; active.innerHTML = row.active_cases; // this builds td&#39;s into tr tr.appendChild(name); tr.appendChild(cases); tr.appendChild(deaths); tr.appendChild(active); // add HTML to container resultContainer.appendChild(tr); } }) }) . I think this code just tries to refetch the API if something does not work. I am not completely sure, but my best guess is that it just uses that and then creates elements based on what it has in the API. It will make a constant number of rows and cells to format the data into. . // catch fetch errors (ie ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { console.error(err); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = err; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); }); &lt;/script&gt;KeyboardEvent .",

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . .

I can reference all the activities we did with the APCSP website, because each activity is posted with tags corresponding to which standards they relate to. . What standards are you looking forward to learning more about? . I am looking forward to learning more about web development and how it can be customized. I also want to learn more about how the Internet processes and sends data, even though we learned a little about it in Big Idea 4. I think it would be interesting to watch the rest of the videos for Big Idea 4. This would be really important because I can learn so much about it and if I finish all the CollegeBoard Videos by the AP Exam, I can just review my notes instead of having to watch the videos all over again. . What other careers can you benefit from being in this pathway? . I can benefit from so many other Careers in the STEM field. The STEM Field is a huge field with so many different job opportunities and wide variety of activities. I have heard from many people that taking this class helps build skills that many jobs use such as web development which can be used by software engineers or business owners.

            "content": "Intro to Engineering at Qualcomm . On October 17, 2022, the WE STEM Club came to Del Norte and offered students in AP Computer Science Classes and other classes an opportunity to listen to the experiences of multiple Qualcomm Employees. These talks were split into two different parts and one talk was on Monday and the other on Tuesday. The talk on Monday was about Intro to Engineering at Qualcomm with Sumalatha Arugolana (Staff Engineer) and Nisha Sethia (Director of Engineering). On Tuesday, the second part of the talk was about Intersections of Business and STEM at Qualcomm with Sreeja Nair (Director of Product Management) and Lindsey Kostas (Staff Machine Learning Engineer). . Sumalatha Arugolana’s Talk . She was inspired by her mother and really gained interest in engineering | She was taught by her mother about math and science before school | She chose engineering because she was inspired by her mother and after college she was able to have a career in Engineering | After finding out what each stream of engineering did, she tried really hard and chose the one she liked the most | She is a Communications Engineer | Her College Experience | Qualcomm wants to bring new technologies to other fields such as automobiles | She works with mobile phones | Engineering is a Team Effort | She takes a lot of breaks from her work such as playing Tennis | She is not always in front of the laptop always and takes a lot of breaks from work | Did not take any college classes in America, only in India | . Nisha Sethia’s Talk . She was really inspired by her father and seeing all the things that he did | Girls were not taken that seriously for a STEM Major | She was very confused and did not know what major to do | She looked around and wanted to see why people chose the majors that they did and she reflected on herself asking what she wanted to do | When she graduated, the cellphone industry was not very big and she did not really know much about it | She was really curious about how the wireless phones worked and how they were able to function | After seeing, these phones she was really passionate about this field and really wanted to learn more about it so she started building 2G Phones | Felt the entire process was new to her | She gained a lot of interest in this field of mobile technologies and has not looked back | She made a goal to learn the system end to end | She joined Qualcomm in early 2010’s and helped to work on the 4G Phones | Today she works on the 5G Phones | To choose which field of engineering you want, keep a growth mindset and it may feel hard but try and get exposed to it and find which parts are your majors | Did not take any college classes in America, only in India | . Insights . After listening to this talk, I think it is very important to not compare yourself to others and that you should always stay curious. One of the questions was which field of engineering should I take, and this was a question that I find myself asking. Right now I want to become a Mechanical Engineering but there are so many options in Engineering. A way to find out which field of engineering is to find new experiences. Knowing there are a lot of fields I think I have narrowed it down to software engineering, hardware engineering, or mechanical engineering, but within those fields there are still a lot of different options. I have tried to expose myself a bit more especially by trying to do a lot of different STEM options like Robotics where I have tried doing Electrical and I am also doing AP Computer Science Principles and am quite interested in that as well. One of the speaker’s sons was challenging himself and majored in Mechanical Engineering. I now want to challenge myself more and participate in more STEM related classes and learn more about the process of Engineering. Getting more exposure to Engineering in High School is really important and it is important to learn all these concepts early on so classes will be easier in the future. . Takeaways . This talk has helped me a lot to realize what I need to do if I really want to go into the Engineering field. This talk has really shown me that I need to take all the challenges I have and the opportunities related to Engineering. I need to show more interest in STEM fields because I am really interested and I need to narrow down the STEM major I want to choose. I am in Robotics but I think I need to participate in Robotics more and make sure I am getting as much exposure as I can. I also think I should really use this Summer to my advantage and try to get more Experiences in the STEM field. .",

The Internet has been around for a while and there are many aspects to it like computing and the hardware. Computers used to be very big and people working that working with a big computer did not want to be alone so the internet was made. CSN - 1.A.1 defines a computing device as a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors. CSN - 1.A.3 says that a computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data. Also CSN - 1.A.7 says that the bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time. CSN - 1.B.1 says that the Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open nonproprietary communication protocols. CSN - 1.C.1 says that information is passed through the Internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets. . CollegeBoard Videos 4.1 Videos 1 and 2 . Video 1: . Computers were really big and they were not very portable and this means that they could not really work with a lot of people | Working with big computers meant not much collaboration so people had the idea of the internet | At the time, computers were big because they needed the size for the hardware such as storage size and computers at the time had small storage | Routers are actually computing devices and they push information | Computers are capable of sending and receiving data | A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network and each packet includes the source and the destination and can be sent | Packets are sent from a computer system or a computer network | A Computer System is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a joint purpose | A Computer Network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data | When you have a computer system, you need a computer network | A computer will take a packet and divide into smaller pieces and then they are sent along multiple different paths and don’t have to be in order | A router helps guide a packet and direct it towards where it is going | Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver. = Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time on a computer network, measured in bits per second | . Video 2: . There are four levels, Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access | There are many different protocols, standards, data formats, used at the Application and Transport layers | Application: HTTP and DNS, how the user is able to connect to the Internet | Network: Focuses on Hardware and the most access network access protocol is Ethernet | Network Access: Data Link, Fiber, MAC, Ethernet, NIC, and Wire and | Internet: IP Address and was designed to be scalable, meaning it can change size when there is a lot of information | Transport: Has TCP and UCP, and TCP does error checking and error recovery so it is slower and UDP performs error checking but not for packets | Intranet is LANs connected by Routers | Local Area Networks (LAN’s) are physical connections and can be limited by hardware and physics | DNS is the Domain Name Service and they are applications that translate a human readable URL to a IP Address | . CollegeBoard Quiz: The Internet Quiz . I took the CollegeBoard quiz about the Internet and out of the 3 questions, I got 2 of the questions right showing that I mostly understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make myself a better developer and understand what errors happened and how to fix them. I got the 3rd question wrong and this question was asking the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet. I understand now and I was just a little confused on the definitions . Takeaways . Computers are used by people all the time, but computers were large so that means that they were not that portable so in order to communicate with others, the internet was made so computers could communicate with each other. Today, many people have access to the Internet, and in order to connect they need a computing device to send and receive data. This is usually the router which many people have that help them to connect to the internet. Data is sent over a network in packets which has data and tells routers where it is from and where it is going. People use the internet to send data all the time and it makes it easier to learn and communicate with others on the Internet. . Model . .",

            "content": "Collaboration | Program Function and Purpose | Program Design and Development | Identifying and Correcting Errors | . CollegeBoard Unit: Identifying and Correcting Errors . Errors in programming happen all the time but many people have a very hard time understanding what errors there are and how to solve them. Understanding the different errors is essential to becoming a proficient programmer. CRD - 2.I.1 says that a logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly. CRD 2.I.2 says that a syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of programming language are not followed. CRD - 2.I.5 says that test cases, hand tracing, visualizations, debuggers, and adding extra output statements are effective ways to find and correct errors. CRD - 2.J.2 is defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate the different expected outcomes that are at or just beyond the extremes of input data. . CollegeBoard Videos 1.4 Videos 1, 2, and 3 . Video 1: . There are 4 types of errors, a logic error, a syntax error, a run-time error, and an overflow error | Programmers that are proficient should be able to notice all three types of errors | Logic Error: Caused by the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm which causes the program to behave unexpectedly | Syntax Error: A mistake when a programmer makes a typo or writes some code or forgets to write code, or maybe wrote code that doesn’t follow the program’s language rules and cause the program to fail | Run-Time Error: This causes the program to fail while running and is commonly known as a bug and to identify it, the program runs initially but fails and can’t complete its processes | Overflow Error: An overflow error is when a program is required to perform a calculation that is outside of defined range of values. Due to memory allocation constraints that programming languages require, certain values are too big to calculate or display. | . Video 2: . The easiest error to identify is usually the syntax error | Most IDE’s display information when there is no syntax error | The error usually shows where the error happened and tells people what to fix | Logic Errors are hard to find and correct which are not always noticed all the time and using test cases is the first strategy programmers use to find logic errors | A logic error is immediately noticed and using test cases is the first strategy programmers use to find logic errors | Hand tracing is another strategy and is useful with iteration or loops | Hand tracing can be useful for small code segments and loops that iterate a small number of times | Hand tracing can show that the algorithm was actually just displaying the last time a number was less than number after the list | Visualizations show graphs, images, color, and etc that can help determine if a program is working correctly | Debuggers use software designed to run a program allowing it to be paused and tested in the midst of running to determine if it is working properly | . Video 3: . Developers must start testing the program and need to think about it | The program specifications list the behaviors, events, and corresponding reponses/outputs the program is to support | Programmers need to define inputs that will determine whether or not the specifications are met | Once inputs and corresponding outputs are determined, programmers test, test, and test | After testing, programmers use the results the revise, refine, and improve their programs | Programmers have to test a program many times to make sure that everything is working | Programmers have to test and then the users have to test and then the programmers change even more | After a lot of testing, the program is finally released to other people | . CollegeBoard Quiz: Identifying and Correcting Errors Quiz . I took the CollegeBoard quiz about Identifying and Correcting Errors and out of the 3 questions, I got 3 of the questions right showing that I understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make myself a better developer and understand what errors happened and how to fix them. This quiz was a little hard especially on the first question because I did not really know how to do it, and I was between two answers, but now I understand it. . Takeaways . Developers face errors all the time and they need to make sure that they have to test a program a lot. There are many types of different errors like the logic error, syntax error, run-time error, and the overflow error. They have to test the program as much as they can and they test it and then get some users to test the program and find errors. When you get an error, there are many changes you can make, and the first step is to identify what the error is and how to solve it. The process of code is long and they need to make sure that everything is working. There are many ways to solve an error and one of them is hand tracing and you can use that to improve your code. .",

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. . In the Nighthawk Coders APCSP you can find an Overview and Examples using APIs:APCSP APIs menu- Using Covid RapidAPI JavaScript frontend API code in APCSP Fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-rapidapi.md | . | Making a Jokes API (this will next API tech talk) Frontend.

Python code that support Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD): https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio/blob/main/model_jokes.py | . | . Hacks . Find and use an API as part of your project. An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. . RapidAPI- Google Developer I used an API from RapidAPI and this helped me and I used Currencies and it listed it Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). | .",

Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 # variable is being assigned #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;This is the menu, what would you like to order?&quot;) print(&quot;To stop ordering please type stop&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) # why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times while True: item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) if item == &quot;burger&quot;: total += 3.99 print(total) elif item == &quot;fries&quot;: total += 1.99 print(total) elif item == &quot;drink&quot;: # == means that you are comparing the variable, don&#39;t assign variable total += 0.99 print(total) elif item == &quot;stop&quot;: print(&quot;Thank You for Ordering, Here is your total:&quot;, total) break else: print(&quot;That is not on the menu&quot;) exit(0) #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user #print(total) . This is the menu, what would you like to order? To stop ordering please type stop burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 3.99 4.98 6.970000000000001 Thank You for Ordering, Here is your total: 6.970000000000001 . Solving Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? I did not know how to use the string | When I typed stop the code always broke | When I typed burger it did not work and ran the else statement | The break crashed the system | . | What are some test cases that can be used? inputting burger and getting the price of burger | adding items to the list and seeing if the total is right | Putting stop to see if the program outputs the right items | . | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. The code was always running the else part so I had to fix my indentation | Whenever I typed something on the menu, it would run the else statement, so I had to add elif to the functions above | . | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project?

            "content": "Collaboration | Program Function and Purpose | Program Design and Development | Identifying and Correcting Errors | . CollegeBoard Unit: Program Design and Development . There is a lot of development that has to go into programs to make the user interactions easier. CRD - 2.E.1 says that a development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. CRD 2.E.2 says that there are multiple development processes. the following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, and testing. CRD 2.F.3 also says that some ways investigation can be performed are with collecting data through surveys, user testing, interviews, and direct observations. CRD - 2.H.1 says that it is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. CRD - 2.G.2 says that comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not how a program runs. . CollegeBoard Videos 1.3 Videos 1, 2, and 3 . Video 1: . A program is always developed with an idea | The idea always has a specific purpose in the mind and the people think about what they want to do and follow some steps | Developers are trying to stick to their plan and follow some specific steps | The Development can be very exploratory and the steps followed are based on what happens, people who are observing early AI Projects look for things to improve on and they try to make changes that might be useful | When making a program, developers have to determine the requirements of the program, understand the constraints like time, understand the user concerns and interests | Developers design the program by brainstorming, storyboarding, planning user experience, laying out the user interface, organizing into modules, and develop a testing strategy | Developers have to choose how a program should behave and include a list of user interactions | . Video 2: . Programs are developed by groups of people and groups use programming from other people and make it for themselves, but they must give credit | Different people or teams work on different components and they all work together as a team | When working in a team, credit must be given to people who were a part of the program, and documentation helps when fixing things and so that person gets credit | The program documentation should include the author’s name and the source of the code segments used | . Video 3: . Comments are used by Developers all the time to tell themselves what their code does and tell collaborators how their code works | In comments, they will describe the program, list program specifications, describe the program, and the list of contributors and authors | The developers will list the specifications of the program like the purpose | Developers keep track of the process while programming | After they are done, they should be able to explain the process | Comments can help the efficiency of programming, and help programmers to find bugs or understand what each piece of code says | To comment in Python, you need to put a # | To comment in Java, you need to put a //, /* Comments/, /** Documentation/ | To comment in HTML, you need to put &lt; !–Comment–&gt; | To comment in AppleScript, you need to (* Comment*) | To comment in Scratch or AppInventor, you can add comments to each block and can be shown when wanted | . CollegeBoard Quiz: Collaboration Quiz . I took the CollegeBoard quiz about Collaboration and out of the 3 questions, I got 3 of the questions right showing that I understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make collaborating with my group more efficient. I can use what I learned to make sure I am a better collaborator. I can add more comments to my code to help my group mates understand what I am trying to do. I can also add comments to my fastpage, so anyone looking at my code can see what I did. . Takeaways . There is a specific purpose for Developers when they are making a program and they have to do a lot of things. They also need to think about a lot and what they can add or change. They also need to do a lot of testing. Developers make a lot of additions based on feedback or they thought of improving something. Developers have to work in groups and they often work in small groups of large groups. They will all work on specific areas and then they will add comments to see what each program does. Documentation is very important for developers especially when they are in a team, so others can understand what is going on and credit can also be given to people. .",

Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function | . | . I noticed that you need to run previous codes because that is the only way the variable is defined. . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook.

Takeaways . I have learned that are there are so many different functions when using a program and that can really help people in their daily lives. I also learned that there are many different types of input, and based on what your input is, the output can change, and events can happen based on actions. There are many different types of computing innovation in our lives, and I should try to innovate on any inventions to help people.

My Church and the community because they are all very nice and they are all supportive | I am grateful for attending Del Norte High School, which offers many courses and the staff present at the school are all very supportive and care about your success | My Family and Friends who really push me to do my best and work hard as much as I can | . Goals for my AP Computer Science Principles Class . I have learned that stress is a real problem and if you want to be truly happy, you have to put in a lot of work. I want to be happy in this class because right now, I feel it is a lot of work and I don’t know how to do it, and that everyone else knows what they are doing, and in order to be more happy in this class, I need to work more. . Make assignments fun and try to code cool programs | I can try to collaborate with my group more so I don’t have so much to do | I can manage my time more | Study the information and review it for the AP Exam | Share tips with people and get ideas from them | . Plan to Succeed in AP Computer Science Principles . It has been established that the skills you learn in AP Computer Science Principles can be really useful towards many different careers. I really hope to learn as much as I can from this class so that in my future, I can continue developing these skills and use them for various actions. . One big thing that would be really helpful would be to update my Timebox each week so that way when it is time for the AP Exam, I can look at it and remember any important topics I need to study from that. . I also hope to do really well on the College Board Quizzes and try on them to see what I really need to go back and review. Another really helpful tool could be my team and I should communicate with them as much as I can so that way, if I have any questions I can ask them and get any help I need with understanding a concept .",

            "content": "Collaboration | Program Function and Purpose | Program Design and Development | Identifying and Correcting Errors | . CollegeBoard Unit: Collaboration . Collaboration is a very important skills and can be used in many different places. According to CRD - 1.A.3, Effective Collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it. Additionally CRD - 1.A.4 says that collaboration includes diverse perspectives that helps to avoid bias in the development of computing innovation, and CRD - 1.A.5 is about the consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations. CRD - 1.A explains how computing innovations are improved through collaboration and CRD - 1.B explains how computing innovations are developed by groups of people. . CollegeBoard Videos 1.1 Videos 1 and 2 . Video 1: . Many Companies use Collaboration in their work | An example of collaboration can be seen with Facebook which is a big company and they have many departments so that means that they have to collaborate with other departments to bring a good experience for the users | Another example of this can be seen with Nintendo with their game called Super Mario Brothers 3 where two people with different ideas made a game with both of those ideas and this also required the teamwork of many other people. | Collaboration brings four skills through collaboration; communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiation | . Video 2: . Pair Programming is a pair who work together when one person programs and the other person will watch them and look at each line to make sure that the code is correct | Think-Pair-Share is when a pair thinks about ideas and then shares them with their partner or the class | Leaving comments in code helps you and your partner know what your code is trying to do | Asking Family and Friends to test out your program is a great way to get some feedback and find things from a new perspective | . CollegeBoard Quiz: Collaboration Quiz . I took the CollegeBoard quiz about Collaboration and out of the 3 questions, I got all 3 of the questions right showing that I understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make collaborating with my group more efficient. . Takeaways . I have learned that Collaboration is a huge part of many different jobs. It does not matter if you are working in a field that is not computer science, collaboration is important to everyone and helps connect things to make one big thing. For example, the way many apps look how they look is because of collaboration, one person can not really do all that so many people from different areas share ideas to make a product that users will enjoy. On the apple website, they need software engineers to program the cool transitions, but they also need artists to design the product so that the programmers can animate it. .",

            "title": "App Lab",
            "content": "Code.org AppLab . We were told to design an app using Code.org with an App Lab. I opened the App Lab and then went to the design tab and added a button to start the quiz. This picture below shows what the window looked like and by the end of this app, I hope it looks much better . My Plan for this AppLab is to make a Quiz about Technology with 4 Questions and I want them to be able to have multiple attempts to get the question right and that way they can for sure get a 100% on the quiz. . Final Draft . AppLab Part 1 - The Design of Homepage and Instruction . I also made a new screen for the rules and how to play page and I added code to make sure when the button was clicked it would switch to the rules and how to play the quiz. Here is a picture of what my homepage looks like . This is a picture of what my instruction page looks like and i used the same code as I did for the first button, I just changed it a little bit to make sure the code detected the right button. . The Designing and Coding of Question 1 . I started to make the questions and the first one would be about who the CEO of Google was and of course that is Sundar Pichai. I made it so that you had to click on the picture to respond. Here is a picture of what the first question looks like and whenever the user clicks on the wrong image, it will tell them that it is wrong and allow them to answer it again. . If the user clicked on the image of Jeff Bezos or anyone else it would send them to this screen . If the user clicked on the image of Sundar Pichai it would send them to this screen . My First Challenge . I have encountered one of my first issues and I have been told that I need to have a score at the end of my quiz, so I plan on just not allowing the users to redo the questions and just letting them have one chance and using variables at the end to tell the user the score. This does help me because this way, I do not have to make separate buttons for each time the user gets a question wrong to send them to next question, but I do have to make more screens, but I will make them look the same. . Designing and Coding of Question 2 . For question 2, I decided to ask a question about Samsung’s new folding smartphones and see if any users actually know about these phones and how Samsung has been able to make their displays foldable. The point of this question is to make users find out about these products and see if they are interested in it. This is what Question 2 looks like when done designing. . I also made the new screens if the user got the question wrong. . For the coding part of the quiz, I decided to use what I did for Question 2 and whenever a button is clicked, if that response is right it will tell them they got it right, but if the response is wrong, it will tell them they got it wrong. I decided to add a variable at the beginning called score. . The Coding Part was really simple, all I did were add 6 blocks and write what to do when the user clicked one of the buttons, here is what the code looked like. . I do want to add the variables for my score but I want to do that later at the end, right now I want to make sure my code actually works. . Designing and Coding of Question 3 . For question 3, I am going to ask a question about electric cars and see if the user knows which one of the cars has the fastest 0-60 mph, and you can actually buy right now today. . After Designing question 3, this is what the questions looks like, there are 4 options, a Tesla Model S Plaid, a Lucid Air Dream Edition, a Rivian R1S, and a Ford Mustang Mach-E. The correct answer will be the Tesla Model S Plaid. . The code is the same for the other two questions and just tells it what to do after a button has been clicked. . Designing and Coding of Question 4 . I did what I made for the previous questions but this time I wanted to focus on Audio and let users see all the different headphone designs by different companies to see what interested them. After finishing designing this Question, this is what it looked like. . Designing and Coding the End with Score . For this part, I decided to design the page by thanking the users for taking my quiz. Also I decided to take the total score of the quiz the user took and let them know what their score was at the end of the quiz. I did this by adding variables and making sure that in the text box at the end the variable score would be shown. . In order to tell the user their score I had to use the variable I had at the end, so I added code to add a point each time the user got a question right, and if they got it wrong the variable would stay the same. Here is a picture of the code that I added for each question. . This tells the user what their score will be at the end of the quiz out of 4. . My Second Challenge . I finished putting all the variable blocks for each one and I tested it, I got one question wrong but at the end of the quiz, this is that image I saw. . In the image, the text box is blank and that means the user does not know their score so I had to try and fix that. In order to fix this, I looked at someone else’s code and found out that I was using the wrong block of code. After looking at someone else’s code, I realized that I was using the wrong block and found out that I was actually defining the variable each time instead of setting the variable to a number. . I found out the right block of code and that basically allowed the variable to be set to the actual score and that variable was kept throughout the whole quiz. This way when I set the text to the actual variable, the key value would show what the user’s score on the quiz was. .",

            "title": "The Apple Far Out Event",
            "content": "Apple’s Far Out Event . On September 7th, 2022, Apple held a Far Out Event where they introduced the iPhone 14, Airpods Pro 2, and 3 new Apple Watches. . Apple iPhones . This year, I saw a model of what the iPhone 14’s would look like and I was not sure whether Apple would actually do that. The render showed the phone with not one, but two cutout notches, one in a circular shape, and next to it in another oval shape. I did not think Apple would do this, but they did with the Pro Models, and used this new hardware to improve their software with Dynamic Island, and instead of leaving screen between the two cutouts, they filled it with black to make it seem like one big oval cutout. . iPhone 14 . On this day, Apple announced 4 new iPhones, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max. This year they did not include an iPhone 14 mini, this is probably because they thought they didn’t need it anymore. However, one thing to note is that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus come with the Apple A15 Chip which is the same chip as the iPhone 13 and the iPhone 13 mini. However, the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro Max come with the newer A16 chip. . iPhone 14 Plus . Instead of the iPhone 14 mini, Apple decided to launch the iPhone 14 Plus which basically was the iPhone 14 but bigger and had a battery size for $100 more. I think they did this was because the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 mini were not selling as much as they had wanted, and for this new plus phone, I think the same will happen as well. . iPhone 14 Pro . I was surprised with this phone because of the new Dynamic Island. There were images that the notch would be a circle cutout and then an oval cutout, and I thought it wouldn’t happen, but it did, but instead they filled the space in between, to look like it was together, and it was one big oval in the middle of the phone. . iPhone 14 Pro Max . Just like recent years, Apple has released a Pro Max version of this years iPhone, which is the same as the iPhone 14 Pro but has a bigger screen and battery. This is the biggest phone that Apple released this year, and it is probably the best phone you can get from Apple this year. . Apple Watches . Apple introduced three new apple watches. The Apple Watch SE (Starting at $299), Apple Watch Series 8 (Starting at $399), and the Apple Watch Ultra (Starting at $799). I was not really expecting the Apple Watch Ultra, but I was impressed with the look of it. All of these Apple Watches come with new Safety Detection Features just like with the new iPhones . Apple Watch SE . This Apple Watch is the budget apple watch for those people who don’t necessarily want to spend or need all of the other features. One big key thing Apple focused on during this event was Safety, especially with Crash Detection and Emergency SOS. Apple brought Crash Detection to this model and all the other apple watches announced here during this event . Apple Watch Series 8 . The Apple Watch Series 8 with a newer processor than last year and it has a temperature sensor. This watch also has crash detection so if it has detected you are in a crash it will notify first responders. It is also now capable of Bluetooth 5.3. This new watch comes with the S8 chip, but this does have the same CPU as the S7 Chip. It also comes with a newer and more powerful gyroscope and a high dynamic range accelerator, probably for the new safety features. Some thing this watch has now is a body temperature sensor, which was not on the Apple Watch Series 7. . Apple Watch Ultra . I was not expecting this watch at all, I was wondering what the purpose of this watch was, and it is for super dedicated athletes. I remember first seeing it at school during lunch and really liked the bands of the Series 8 Watch, but not so much the shape of the actual watch. Then I realized it was a whole new watch, and was made for professional athletes. . Airpods Pro 2 . During this event, Apple also announced a new generation of the Apple Airpods Pro’s which has the same look as the original ones, but the case now supports MagSafe Charging. Additionally, these new earbuds have improved noise cancellation and better sound quality. These improved earbuds now have richer bass. One big feature we have seen here is adaptive transparency mode which lets you hear some outside, but not all of them. .",

Using a While Loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Using a Recursive Loop . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

            "content": "When you make a fastpage from fastai, if you want to change the style, you have to go to the _sass folder but by default it is known as minima. I tried to change the minima but it resulted in an error message . This was the error message I got when I changed the theme to something else, in this case, I did minimal instead of minima . In the above image we see that everything worked except the Jekyll build because it did not recognize that and it was not able to deploy it on the website so the actual appearance of the fastpage did not change . After choosing a theme, I decided to choose slate and afterwards I realized my website did not work. The style was completely different and I liked it but one issue I found was that when I clicked on a post, I couldn’t click the title to go back to the page and the home page was completely different and the posts’ format was different as well .",

            "title": "Thoughts on the Alumni Panel",
            "content": "AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A Alumni Panel . On August 29th, 2022, 6 AP Computer Science Alumni that graduated Del Norte came from their colleges to talk to the students taking the class right now. . I attended the panel for 3 reasons; 1, I obviously wanted the extra credit; 2. I knew one of the panelists and wanted to see her thoughts; 3. I wanted to learn more about Computer Science and their experiences . The Beginning of the Panel . In the beginning of the panel was when everyone introduced themselves and what college they went to and what major they were doing. . When Colin said that he was a Mechanical Engineer at UCSD, I started listening closely to him because I wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer and I wanted to go to UCSD. 🤓🔧🎓 . Questions asked during the Panel . In the First Question, I learned that Computer Science is a very important skill and this really helps people in their daily lives. Nitya said that computer science really helps you to develop skills that are really important in other parts of your life. One example of this is that computer science can be frustrating and there can be so many errors that you have to learn to fix. Problem Solving is a huge skill that really helps in so many different areas. On top of this, when trying to solve problems you may go to others and find a solution together helping you to develop social skills which are also very useful. . Allison said that AP Computer Science Principles has really helped her with learning to develop websites which has gotten her many internships and helped her to get a lot of volunteering time. . Nitya also said that when she took the class during the pandemic, her and her group worked together to make a database about COVID-19 statistics and she realized that coding can be used to really help people around the world. This reminds me of a person I know who made websites for small businesses during the pandemic, and his web development skills are nice . Challenges faced during the class . When asked a question about challenges they had to overcome, a common answer was trying to understand all the programming content in the beginning weeks because they had to solve a lot of problems and had a lot of errors. Many of them felt that it was hard at the beginning even though some of them had prior experience, they still faced a lot of problems with their code. . Another Problem was that they were comparing themselves to others a lot and making themselves feel bad because they didn’t get an Internship at Google. Anthony even said that one of the not so great things you could do was look at other people’s linkedin profiles and seeing how many qualifications they have. . As mentioned before, coding can help in so many different areas and is an important skill to learn. I learned from the panelists that coding can really help in a high-level math class and Jupyter Notebooks helps in some classes as well. . Internships and Volunteering . In the beginning of the class, Mr. Mortensen mentioned that many students can get an internship from APCSP or APCSA and many have chosen that path. I know that Nitya did an internship with a professor at UCSD and now she studies at UCSD majoring in Computer Science. I also learned that many of the panelists did internships with their school. I also learned that the internships from major companies usually open up in September or in November, which really helps me because I want an internship. You can also even get an internship from an IT school which would be really helpful for experience. A popular company for internships seemed to be Northrup Grumman and they usually only take 20 students from PUSD. It is also really helpful to have a lot of linkedin friends or your friend’s parents for an internship at their work if you want to because referrals make it a lot easier to get an Internship. High School Internees can usually find one at a small company. . I also learned that Computer Science has helped with volunteer hours as I mentioned earlier as some people built websites for people such as Allison. She said that she volunteered at a church and helped build a website for them. . My Takeaways . ONE major takeaway I learned was that coding was a really important skill and is used all the time in different jobs and majors. Colin, who I was listening to because he was a mechanical engineer at UCSD, which is what I wanted to do, said that during his build projects he codes a script. This has made me want to practice coding way more because in the future if I can solve problems faster as a mechanical engineer than others, I have a higher chance of getting hired. . I was happy to hear that as a Mechanical Engineer at UCSD, Colin had to do a hands-on project as a freshman and in his senior year, he has to do another hands-on project. He said he used coding to help him speed up the build process .",

            "content": "Computer Science is focused a lot on Problem Solving and if you find interest in the class, it is such a really good experience . Computer Science is a really important skill and is very useful in your daily life even if you don’t want to major in Computer Science, the class teaches you skills in other majors such as Problem Solving . Allison said that web development was a really important skill that she learned that she uses very frequently and Computer Science Principles really helped her develop that skill . This class has helped many people such as Nitya to realize that Computer Science can be used in the real world. . A Big Challenge for Computer Scientists was starting and getting a lot of people saying how they were so good at Computer Science and this makes you feel like you need to compare yourself to them. . As a Mechanical Engineer at UCSD, you have to do a hands-on project freshman year and another hands-on project senior year, and you have to make the most of it. Computer Science was a class that helped the alumni to develop skills such as social skills and help them to understand how you learn the best. . The Mechanical Engineer at UCSD has used so much information from Computer Science for his major. Coding is everywhere and is really helpful for some projects and can help save a lot of time. Coding can help a lot in high-level math classes and Jupyter Notebooks are really helpful in some activities in College . Computer Science Principles and Computer Science A is really helpful to help you get internships at Colleges. I know Nitya got an internship at UCSD for Computer Science and this really helped her with her transition to UCSD. Code Ninjas is also a job with Computer Science that can help you a lot, Additionally, you can learn a lot from internships at IT schools. Allison helped a church group and did graphic design. Nitya did an internship at Northrup Grumman, but they only usually take 20 students from PUSD. . Colin who is a mechanical engineer at UCSD was able to use programming during his education at UCSD to help him solve problems. These problems would take too long without code, so coding has really helped him with building things. . This September and November are when most major companies start hiring for summer internships, and you need a resume, Smaller Companies usually take High School Student Internees. Ask some of your friends’ parents for an internship at a company. .",

            "content": "Last week in American Literature 1 . This past week, we had to write two poems in my class, one was finding words from a poem and making one from that, and then we had to make two new poems with our words. . The other poem was to write an actual poem using your own words . The First Poem about Immigration . An Immigrant Coincidence I came to America in hope for this promised life Once I arrived everything was out of sight Treated like an outstander with a lowlife I applied for a job but had to put up a fight . They directed me towards the department of agriculture With no friends, I sought a subculture Found myself surrounded by those with a similar incidence I don’t think this was a coincidence . I feel I have found my place Where everyone is alike with the same mission The relationship between us is like a baseball team trying to go to base Crowds of people all with a comforting smile, I finally feel recognition . Though this country may have a bell that rings liberty It reminds me of the taste of bitter tea So I say this country is only as good as it’s people . The Second Poem about Immigration . Shielded from the Warfare I thought this new world would be a place to call home But I have no freedom to roam At the park, I saw a bald eagle An American Symbol, yet making me feel illegal . I thought this country would be full of opportunities Hoping to make use of all the amenities Despite the uninviting feeling It does feel a little freewheeling . I thought this country would make me smaller Yet every day I feel more like a scholar The education here is like none other It feels great to not have to suffer . I thought this country wouldn’t care All of this to get away from warfare When I got here, all I could think of was being free The thought of getting a college degree . I thought this country would provide me with a shield And it has helped me become healed I am still discovering my capability Overjoyed with all the possibilities .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

Def: This defines a variable which is useful when using input and output in a program . Input: This is what the user inputs into the code . Output: Based on the user’s output the code will give something to the user . Procedural Abstraction: Grouping a sequence of commands and is used repeatedly . Protocol: Something that helps you to send and receive data . Unit 2 . Bits: The smallest unit of information in a computer, can either equal 0 or 1, and 8 bits are equal to one byte . Bytes: A basic unit of measurement for pieces of information; the space required to store one character . Hexadecimal/Nibbles: Pertaining to the base-16 number system represented by the digits 0 through 9 and the uppercase or lowercase letters A (equivalent to decimal 10) through F(equivalent to decimal 15) . Binary Numbers: A number expressed in binary form, or base, like 1100 which is 12 . Unsigned Integer: A data type that can only hold a whole number with a value greater than, or equal to, zero . Signed Integer: An integer that has a positive or negative sign . Floating Point: A number represented by an exponent according to a given base and to find the value of a floating-point number, the base is raised to the power of the exponent . Binary Data: A type of data that is represented or displayed in the binary numeral system . Abstractions: Extraction of relevant information from a larger data set, where utilizing abstraction allows engineers and others to simplify a codebase . Boolean: Pertaining to, or characteristic of logical (true, false) values . ASCII: Stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange and is a language that is just made up of symbols, its a standard single-byte character encoding scheme used for text-based data using designated 7-bit or 8-bit number combinations to represent either 128 or 256 possible characters. . Unicode: A character-encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world . RGB: The three colors used by a computer screen, all the other colors can be made up by mixing red, blue and green . Data Compression: A reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data . Lossy: If a process is lossy, it means that a little quality is lost when it is performed, meaning if a format is lossy, it means that putting data into that format will cause some slight loss . Lossless: Restores and rebuilds file data in its original form after the file is decompressed . Unit 3 . Variables: A named storage location capable of containing data that can be modified during a program’s run . Data Types: A classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations . Assignment Operators: The operator used to assign a new value to a variable, property, event or indexer element . Managing Complexity with Variables: This is for making sure that variables have a specific value so that the code can run . Lists: A table of records located in the main area for each computer in the user interface . 2D Lists: a two-dimensional data structure stored linearly in the memory, it has rows and columns . Dictionaries: A collection of keys or key and value pairs that is used for content or query processing in search . Class: A set of objects that share a common definitional property, that share common operations and behavior, or both . Algorithms: A rule or procedure for solving a problem . Sequence: An ordered arrangement, as in a set of numbers, such as the Fibonacci sequence . Selection: A programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met . Iteration: Repeated runs of one or more statements or instructions. Statements or instructions so executed are said to be in a loop . Expressions: Any combination of operators, constants, literal values, functions, and names of fields (columns), controls, and properties that evaluates to a single value . Comparison Operators: Can compare numbers or strings and perform evaluations, like &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, &gt;, and === . Booleans Expressions and Selection: An expression that yields a Boolean value (true or false), such expressions can involve comparisons (testing values for equality or, for non—Boolean values, the &lt; [less than] or &gt; [greater than] relation) and logical combination (using Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and XOR) of Boolean expressions, a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met . Booleans Expressions and Iteration: An expression that yields a Boolean value (true or false), such expressions can involve comparisons (testing values for equality or, for non—Boolean values, the &lt; [less than] or &gt; [greater than] relation) and logical combination (using Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and XOR) of Boolean expressions, a process where the design of a product or application is improved by repeated review and testing . Truth Tables: A tabular representation of all the combinations of values for inputs and their corresponding outputs . Characters: A letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbols . Strings: A group of characters or character bytes handled as a single entity, computer programs use strings to store and transmit data and commands . Length: The amount of items in a list, and can be used as it’s own variable . Concatenation: The process of combining two or more character strings or expressions into a single character string or expression, or combining two or more binary strings or expressions into a single binary string or expression . Upper: An element greater than or equal to all the elements in a given set . Lower: An element lesser than or equal to all the elements in a given set . Traversing Strings: It cuts off a substring from the original string and thus allows to iterate over it partially . Python If: A selection statement that allows more than one possible flow of control . Elif: This is short for else if and is used when the first if statement isn’t true, but you want to check for another condition . Else conditionals: A statement that runs a different set of statements depending on whether an expression is true or false . Nested Selection Statements: Used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a tas . Python For: A control flow statement that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied . While loops with Range: Uses a while function and used to create a sequence ranging between a certain limit . With List: An abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once . Combining loops with conditionals to Break: If a function is true or false, the break can be used in order to stop the function once a conditional has been reached . Continue: This statement passes control to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing do, for, or while statement in which it appears, bypassing any remaining statements in the do, for, or while statement body . Procedural Abstraction: The idea that each method should have a coherent conceptual description that separates its implementation from its users . Python Def procedures: A procedure allows us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name . Parameters: A value that is given to a variable, either at the beginning of an operation or before an expression is evaluated by a program . Return Values: A single value that is the result of the execution of a statement, method, or function . Iteration: Repetition of a Process . For Loop: FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated . While Loop: The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met . Initialization: What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0. . Condition: Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop. . Increment/Decrement: Modifies the counter variable after each repetition. . Indexing / List Index: The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 . Nesting: Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops. . Array: Another name for a list, depends on the language .",
