In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | This person’s solution to the program without the list is not really that great, and the use of a list does not really seem like it is making the program any easier, instead of returning a list, they could’ve just used a string | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 1 | Did not really talk about the overall functionality of the program while also talking about what the procedure does, and it is then used in a really inefficient way, but the parameter is there and is defined | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 1 | This person was able to implement the code and explain it all very well, but they did not really show sequencing that much, but I did see a lot of iteration and some selection in the program | . Testing | 1 | 1 | This person has included a lot of information about the two calls, and they were able to identify the result of each call with the use of implicit and explicit parameters, and different parts of the code are being run | .

            "content": "This Group: Zeen, Shaurya, Vardaan, Navan, and Justin . HACK 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . Decidable Problems are problems that algorithms can return an output for all inputs, and an example of this can be checking to see if a number is even or odd. Undecidable Problems are problems that algorithms can not solve very simply, and they are usually algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies. . import random # Decidable Problem number = random.randint(1,10) print(&quot;The Number is&quot;, number) if number % 2 == 0: print(&quot;This is an Even Number&quot;) else: print(&quot;This is an Odd Number&quot;) . The Number is 4 This is an Even Number . import random number = 1 while number == 0: print(number) number = number + 1 if number &gt; 0: print(&quot;The value of Number is greater than 0&quot;) . The value of Number is greater than 0 . HACK 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . My Answer: C . Explanation: This is the correct choice because this answer has two integers that are being multiplied together, but then it is being squared so this will take a 3 step algorithm. It can&#39;t be none of them because option C is true, and all of the above can not be true because option B is exponential. Option C is a quadratic however. The first step would be 3 x 8, the second step is getting a value of 24, and the third step would be squaring that value. . HACK 3 . Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length return `The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak` }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . function peak_finder2(array) { if(array.length) == 0: return `Array cannot be empty` else { if(array.length == 1) return array[0] } else { let mid_index = Math.floor(array.length*0.5) } if (array[mid_index +1]&gt;array[mid_index]) { return peak_finding(array.slice(mid_index + 1 )) } else if (array[mid_index -1]&gt;array[mid_index]) new = array.reverse().slice(mid_index+1).reverse() return peak_finding(new) else { return array[mid_index] } } . Cell In[43], line 1 function peak_finder2(array) ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . array = [3, 1, 4, 5, 2] function peak_finder(array) let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index = 0 if (counter === 0) if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]) peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length else: counter += 1 if (counter &gt;= peak_index) array.append(r) peak = a[1] counter = array.array else: counter += 1 peak_finder() . 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 2 checks to find 4 . I did not really understand what we were supposed to do here with this code because an array was not really provided. I was not really sure how I was supposed to implement binary search here, additionally, the code was in a lot of different places, and I was not really sure what was going on, but I knew that it was trying to sort out an array. . HACK 4 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] print(&quot;Before Sorted List:&quot;, data) print(&quot;The Length of the list is&quot;, len(data)) data.sort() print(&quot;After Sorted List:&quot;, data) . Before Sorted List: [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] The Length of the list is 10 After Sorted List: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . This Problem was pretty simple because I could just use the sort() function which made it really easy for me to do this algorithm instead of having to sort it with the other piece of code. This method saves a lot of time, and it is not as overwhelming to look at, it also is easy for other users to understand. . HACK 5 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def heap_permutation(data, n): if n == 1: print(data) return for i in range(n): heap_permutation(data, n - 1) if n % 2 == 0: data[i], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[i] else: data[0], data[n-1] = data[n-1], data[0] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . data = [1, 2, 3] heap_permutation(data, len(data)) . [1, 2, 3] [2, 1, 3] [3, 1, 2] [1, 3, 2] [2, 3, 1] [3, 2, 1] . I am not exactly sure why just deleting the top part of the code basically just gives us the same output. My guess is that heap_permutation is already its own parameter, so this means that it is able to shuffle all the different possibilities with the data . Extra . I want to see what else I can do with the heap_permutation parameter . small_password = [0, 1] heap_permutation(small_password, len(small_password)) password = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] # Dont want cell output too big . [0, 1] [1, 0] . dice_roll = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] heap_permutation(dice_roll, len(dice_roll)) .

            "content": "Background . Kathyleen Beveridge (Project Management) and Kris Porter (Developer Operation) and Kevin Warmerdam (Software Engineering). According to Mr, Mortensen, these two people are from Qualcomm and they are some of his old colleagues. . # Notes Notes that I took during the SD STEM Startups and Girls in CS Panel with three speakers, but one of them did not come . I was very surprised to see how many students from APCSP and APCSA showed up today . ## Kathyleen . Born in Vietnam and lived in the Bay Area and San Jose | Moved to San Diego in 2004 | She studied in Spain | Received Financial Degree from Santa Clara University in the Bay Area | Favorite Quote by Maya Angelou: “My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.” | Her first job was an investment banker but she did not like it and then she switched to tech afterwards | She learned to surf but realized surfing doesn’t pay the bills | She joined Qualcomm a couple of years ago and works now at Thermo Fisher Inc, as well as switched to High Tech | She has worked at 3 Companies for a long time which were HP, Qualcomm, and Thermo Fisher Inc (Current Employment) | Mission Statements of each of the companies are all very similar and mention wanting to help the people and make sure their lives are easier | Qualcomm chips used to be in 99% of all cellphones | She is the Senior Director of Marketing at Thermo Fisher | . Kris Porter . He took Physics and some Computer Science Classes | He went to UCLA for some classes and got his Bachelor’s Degree | His first Computer Science Class was the 2nd quarter at UCLA and was not very good at it | The first Computer Science Class he took, he was not very good at it and he kind of failed, and the 2nd time he took a Computer Science Class, he got a C, but he still moved on and learned | Was very hard for him to get a job in 2008 when the Stock Market was not in a stable condition | He worked in some Tech Areas but he wanted in the Tech Space he wanted to be in | As time went on, he slowly worked towards becoming a Development Operator | A Development Operator is someone who deploys the software and they make sure everything is secure and goes as planned | When Security is said, it is not his primary occupation to secure the network but more to look at it and see if everything goes as planned | He moved down to San Diego because his girlfriend lived here | He was looking for a new role and then found Qualcomm and was hired by Mr. Mortensen 😲 | He has worked on a bunch of different types of learning like Continuous Learning | He also used to Work at Twitter specifically at a lot of different Data Centers | Everything in Twitter used to be a REST API until 2 years ago | He works currently at a company called Mysten Labs | He has been in San Diego since 2003 | . Questions . Arushi prepared some questions . Do you have any experience in Methodology and Can You Explain it? | Kris: Different Companies have different methods of Agile Methodology. Qualcomm had a group of 150 engineers and they had many meetings that took a couple of days. THey always had a roadmap of what they were going to do . Kathyleen: Used short sprints and maybe 3 months. Agile Methodology . Kris, do you still work at Twitter? | Kris: No, I don’t work at Twitter anymore, I actually work at a company called Mysten Labs now . Mr Mortensen: Ever Since Elon Musk said he was going to buy the company, Kris knew that he needed to search for another job based on prior experiences. . What do you think is the most important skill to have? | Kris: I found the most useful overtime to be Continuous Learning and the thing is not just learning a specific programming language, but learning how to learn efficiently and grasp the most information. Don’t really be concerned and everything will fall into place. . Kathyleen: 100%, Continuous Learning as well as learn to be adaptive because of my career path, I had seen many things happen during these 35 years and it is important that you are adaptive to change. The Best Technical People I’ve worked with are people who listen to the requirements and translate it into technology. . What is the most important thing you have seen while working? | Kathyleen: . Kris: The most important thing that I have seen are interviews especially in Silicon Valley, and there is so much code . Kris: I have worked with many people that have been coding and that they want to code. I have two young kids and I want to have off hours, so sometimes I have to work overtime . What happens at Twitter? | Kris: Twitter is not the only company that does this, Meta as well. THe thing that they build internally is no where else, you can’t find it anywhere else like on Github or on the public. THe engineers built all the things at the company just by trying it. Twitter has things like nginx that is unique to it so new employees have to learn it . How do you think learning how to Code would help in Business? | Kathyleen: People are not old mannered and there is a lot of tech. I would say that if you learn how to code it is like a way of thinking and a different way of looking at problems, it is like critical thinking. Being a critical thinker can help you in interviews and become a good problem solver. . How would coding help with Investment | Kathyleen: Yes, as I mentioned earlier coding can be really beneficial to investment and can help when trading with stocks and making patterns. This also helps with critical thinking and can help with many other things in the future. . Takeaways and Reflection . After listening to this panel, I have found myself becoming more and more excited about Computer Science. Based on prior experiences and events, I have learned many times that Computer Science can help you in so many different fields. I want to become a Mechanical Engineer when I grow up, and recently Westview held a similar event with CTE Panelists, I attended and afterwards I talked with a current Mechanical Engineer. He told me that there are so many different things he does, and knowing how to code was one of them, he says that Computer Science unlocks so many different skills, for example he is currently working on an Arduino Project, which is new to him, but with his prior knowledge, it is making it a lot easier to understand how to do it. To connect this to today’s event, Kathyleen mentioned that although she works in a finance department, Computer Science has helped her to develop skills such as Critical Thinking which also led to being able to become a good Problem Solver. Additionally, Kris also mentioned that Continuous Learning was a good skill to have and that Computer Science has sort of exposed him to this way of learning allowing him to be an expert in different fields and understand different areas of work. . To conclude, this event has really taught me that Computer Science is a very important skill even if you don’t plan on taking a major with Computer Science. Even if you don’t like Computer Science, taking this class can open your eyes up to so much more new perspectives and whenever you face a problem, you can look at it in the eyes of a programmer. Computer Science can help one to develop skills that is necessary in many other careers with the benefit of learning how to program. Personally, I think I should continue Computer Science even after High School. I have been keeping my eye on the Harvard Computer Science Class for a while, and I think this event has inspired me to finally start it. .",

Software libraries contain procedures used in creating novel programs | Existing code segments can be derived from internal or external sources Libraries | Previously written code | . | Libraries simplify complex programs | APIs (application program interfaces) specify how procedures in libraries should behave | Documentation for APIs/Libraries are necessary to gain proper understanding on how to use them | We can use the code random.shuffle to help us to shuffle a list and randomize it and a library | In CollegeBoard pseudo-code RANDOM(a, b) is used to generate a random integer value in the range from a to b | In Python the random library can be imported and the min and max ranges can be set to any integer | A general way to to write this is randint(start, stop) where start is the minimum value, stop is the maximum value This can help make a coin-flip, dice roll, and anything else which needs a range | . | . Vocabulary . Documentation: Text that explains the what, how, or why of your code | Libraries: A collection of pre-written code or procedures that coders can use to maximize their efficiency | Application Programming Interface: A type of software through several computers are able to communicate information amongst each other | . (1) Reflection . Thorough notes(shown above) or summary that reflects understanding of today&#39;s lesson. . Today&#39;s notes were all about Libraries and Variables. When talking about Libraries, API&#39;s were mentioned, which we have had some experience with already, and they are very useful in the Computer Science Field. They can help you a lot when you are trying to code something. API&#39;s are very useful for using, finding, and collecting pre-determined data. Another part of the lesson that was mentioned was about Documentation which is basically text that explains the logistics behind your code. It&#39;s like justifying your work in Math, you basically use Documentation to ensure you and other programmers know what your code is for, and if you need help on it, people can easily understand your intentions. There is nothing wrong with adding a lot of information with your code, it might not be necessary, but not adding enough documentation can cause problems for other programmers and yourself. If you look back on a segment of code you made a while ago, you might read the documentation and think the code has a different purpose than it originally had. Randomization was also mentioned, and this is useful especially in lists and algorithms that rely on things of chance like a coin flip or rolling a dice, these are examples of random occurrences. I have learned that randomization is used a lot in Python because it is so important in lists, and many games and websites actually use it. . Did both notes and a summary . (2) Multiple Choice . What does the random(a,b) function generate? | A. A random integer from a to be exclusive . B. A random integer from a to b inclusive. . C. A random word from variable a to variable b exclusive. . D. A random word from variable a to variable b inclusive. . My Answer: B . Explanation: This is because that you want to make sure that you include a and b within the randomized list, you can not exclude it because it is a range that includes it. This means that it can&#39;t be exclusive. Next, we know that a and b are integers and that they are the index of a list that are connected to a list, so since it is a range, it will only work for integers in a list, also since we are using random, that is why a random integer from a to b is being chosen. . What is x, y, and z in random.randrange(x, y, z)? | A. x = start, y = stop, z = step . B. x = start, y = step, z = stop . C. x = stop, y = start, z = step . D. x = step, y = start, z = stop . My Answer: A . Explanation: In this function, the parameters are start, stop, and step. First, off I know that x has to be start, and this is because it is a range, and you want to start off with the beginning of the list, and then y has to be stop because it has to know when to stop. This tells the range to stop, and the list will stop there, and this means that z has to be the step, which tells the code what the increment of the values should be. Step should go last because the code needs to know the range of the list before the step. . Which of the following is NOT part of the random library? | A. random.item . B. random.random . C. random.shuffle . D. random.randint . My Answer: A . Explanation: I have seen random.randint be used before especially in pseudocode and also in the examples and practice problems that we did for this lesson, it just generates a random integer. Additionally, I have also seen random.shuffle used during this lesson to simulate random chances like a number generator or flipping a coin. Then, random.random is a thing, and all it does is generate a float between 0 and 1. Item() is it&#39;s own parameter and does not need to be randomized and it can just act as it&#39;s own. This means that random.item is not an actual thing, so my answer is Option A. . (3) Short Answer Questions . What is the advantage of using libraries? Libraries are so beneficial, and in fact I have been told this by many people. One of my good friends, Raunak, who likes to program a lot says that he uses API&#39;s, which are libraries with a lot of information, and he uses them frequently because it is so easy. I have heard from so many different people that using API&#39;s is a very easy method for making sure that we can use it and display code very easily. Another example of this is when Kris, a panelist, came to our school and talked about how Twitter used REST API until about 2 years ago.

Create a program to randomly generate one of those 5x5 square CollegeBoard robot courses frequently seen in these lessons. Here are the criteria: | No need to create a graphical user interface (output the course in graphical form); that would be too demanding. You can use store your randomizations in variables to be printed, after which you can sketch one instance of your output using any means (hand drawn, google drawings, etc.) to attach to your submission as an image. . | Your illustration can differ graphically from CollegeBoard&#39;s illustrations as long as the robot, its direction, the wall squares, and the goal square are fairly self-evident (ie you can make the goal a present or food instead of a gray square) . | . You must randomize the following: . Initial direction of the robot (up, down, left, right) | Initial Position of the robot | Goal position | Positions of at least 12 wall/obstacle squares | The latter three must be mutually exclusive (on different squares). This prevents you from generating a course where the robot is on the goal, on a wall square, or the goal is in a wall square . import random direction = [&quot;north&quot;, &quot;south&quot;, &quot;west&quot;, &quot;east&quot;] itemDirection = random.choices(direction) print(f&quot;Initial direction of the robot: {itemDirection}&quot;) goalPosition = [] for i in range(1): r=random.randrange(1,10) goalPosition.append(r) .

This one is tough, so if you manage to do it you&#39;re pretty much guaranteed to get 1.0 points. This will not likely be the only way to get a perfect score, however. . &lt;/div&gt; .",

            "content": "This Group: Caleb, Qais, James, and Krishiv . Notes . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values Procedures can be referred to as method or function depending on the programing language. | A procedure call interrupts an execution of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure. | . | Arguments specify the values of the parameters | If you have a set of statements and there is a procedure, when it reaches that procedure it will execute it and then go back to the rest of the statements | If you see a return statement you automatically end the procedure even if there is more statements | If you have a set of statements in a procedure, the statement will go through the top of the procedure to the bottom in order | There are two types of procedures, one that returns a value or some type of data and on that just executes a block of statements | One common type of abstraction is procedural abstraction, which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be only knowing what it doe,not how it does it. | The subdivision of a computer program into separate subprograms called modularity | To name a procedure, it must be in all capitals meaning PROCEDURE and then the functions name should be lowercase, unless there is a part when a new word starts, so the first letter of the word should be capitalized | . Vocabulary . Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that serves a purpose | Parameter: are input values of a procedure | Modularity: the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | . 3.12 Hacks Part 1 . Skipped Question 1 . Problem 2: . Qais is writing code to calculate formulas from his math class. He&#39;s currently working on a procedure to calculate average speed, based on this formula: . Average speed= . Total Time/Total Distance ​ . Highlight which of these is the best procedure for calculating and displaying average speed. PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } | PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } | PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) } | . | . Explanation: It is the first option because we want to calculate the averages of the distances and the times, and in order to calculate the average speed, we need to do distance over time. . . Problem 3: Procedures with return values . James Hunter is looking through his classmate&#39;s program and sees a procedure called heightenEmotions: PROCEDURE heightenEmotions(myEmotion) . { moreEnergy ← CONCAT(myEmotion, &quot;!!!&quot;) . moreVolume ← UPPER(moreEnergy) . RETURN moreVolume } . That procedure manipulates strings using two built-in procedures, CONCAT for concatenating two strings together, and UPPER for converting a string to uppercase. . James Hunter then sees this line of code: . heightenEmotions(&quot;im mad&quot;) . After that line of code runs, will nothing be displayed? . True . False . Explanation: Nothing will show up because the inside is not an actual function. Even if it was defined as a function, that would only apply to the things outside of the parentheses. The parameter on the inside would not be defined and it does not really exist, but you can make it into DISPLAY(&quot;im mad&quot;) . . Problem 4: Procedures with return values . Bubz is writing a program to calculate the carbon footprint of his activities. The procedure calcFlightFootprint calculates the pounds of carbon dioxide produced per passenger in a flight that covers a given number of miles and seats a given number of passengers. . PROCEDURE calcFlightFootprint(numMiles, numPassengers) { CO2_PER_MILE ← 53.29 . carbonPerFlight ← numMiles * CO2_PER_MILE . carbonPerPassenger ← carbonPerFlight / numPassengers . RETURN carbonPerPassenger . } . Bubz wants to use that procedure to calculate the total footprint for his two upcoming flights: LA to NY: 2,451 miles and 118 passengers NY to London: 3,442 miles and 252 passengers . Which of these code snippets successfully calculates and stores her total footprint? Highlight 2 answers. . totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) + calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) . | totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118 + 3442, 252) . | | totalFootprint ← calcFlightFootprint((2451, 118) + (3442, 252)) . 4. laNyCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(2451, 118) nyLondonCarbon ← calcFlightFootprint(3442, 252) totalFootprint ← laNyCarbon + nyLondonCarbon . Explanation: It is 1 and 3 because we can calculate the total footprint individually and then find the total by adding the two values up. Option 3 is similar to this because it runs the function in one but calculates it twice, it is like another way to write it. Option 2 does not work because it will just add them together before starting the function, and Option 4 might not work because the variables aren&#39;t being reset, I am not sure, this one was a little confusing for me to find out. . 3.12 Homework/Hacks part 2 . Practice Problem . Here is a practice problem that involves calling a procedure by having an input and an output. This is a apply discount and apply tax procedure. . $80 item receives a 20% discount and a tax is 8% . PROCEDURE applyDiscount (cost, percentDiscounted) { temp &lt;-- 100 - percentDiscounted . temp &lt;-- temp / 100 cost &lt;-- cost x temp Print(cost) . } . PROCEDURE applytax (cost, cpercentDiscounted) { temp &lt;-- 100 + percentTaxed . temp &lt;-- temp / 100 cost &lt;-- cost x temp Print(cost) . } . Explanation: I think it would be the first procedure because you should only find the price with tax after it has been discounted . Temperature Procedure . What is 80 degrees Fahrenheit in Celsius . PROCEDURE convert Fahrenheit (temperature) { . Celsius &lt;-- temperature - 32 Celsius &lt;-- Celsius x 5/9 Print (Celsius) . } . Explanation: The answer would be ~26.7 because when you plug it in Celsius is assigned to the value of 48 and then reassigned with a value of ~26.7 and then it is printed out . Problem 1 . a -- ? b -- ? c -- 9 PROCEDURE find a () { b &lt;-- 9 9 a &lt;-- b c Print (a) } What is a? cost ⟵ 173 tax - 10% PROCEDURE applytax (cost, cpercentDiscounted){ temp &lt;-- 100 + percentTaxed temp &lt;-- temp / 100 cost &lt;-- cost x temp Print(cost)} . What is the cost? . Explanation: Well since c has a value of 9 and b has a value of 81 (99), then we can find out a since it is just b c, so it becomes 81 * 9, which assigns 729 to a . Tempature - 103 Degrees PROCEDURE convert Fahrenheit (tempature) { Celsius &lt;-- tempature - 32 Celsius &lt;-- Celsius x 5/9 Print (Celsius)} . Explanation: The Answer should be 39.4 degrees celsius because we are just taking 103 and going through the function. We are subtracting 32 from 103 and then multiplying it by 5/9 to get ~39.4 . 3.13 Homework/Hacks for Part 1 and Part 2 of the lesson . Problem 1 . Create a procedure that is meant to replace the top running backs yards per game in one season if the current running back has more yards per game .

Problem 3 . Which Is the Correct Way to define the Name of a Procedure? . A. PROCEDURE MYLIST | B. PROCEDURE MyList | C. procedure mylist Click For Hint Remember the word procedure should be in all capitals and a part of the declared procedure should be in caps | . Explanation: B, because you want to make sure the PROCEDURE is in all caps and when defining a function it should be lowercase unless you are starting a new word, and you can&#39;t put a space, so you capitalize the first letter of the words . Problem 4 . Write A Procedure That gets the BeachBall To the Green Square .

            "content": "This Group: Eli, Trent, Khalid, and Samarth . 3.9 Video 1 . Notes . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks and this also means that the algorithms can appear similar yet yield different side effects or results | Some conditional statements can be written as equivalent Boolean expressions | Some Boolean expressions can be written as equivalent conditional statements | Different algorithms can be developed or used to solve the same problem | Algorithms can be created from an idea, either by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying existing algorithms | Knowledge of existing algorithms can help in constructing new ones. Some existing algorithms include Determining the maximum or minimum value of two or more numbers | Computing the sum or average of two or more numbers | Identifying if an integer is or is not evenly divisible by another integer | Determining a robot’s path through a maze | . | Using existing correct algorithms as building blocks for constructing another algorithm has benefits such as reducing development time, reduce testing, and simplifying the identification of errors | For binary search algorithms Determine the number of iterations required to find a value in a data set. | Explain the requirements necessary to complete a binary search. | . | The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of a sorted data set of numbers and eliminates half of the data; this process repeats until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated. | Data must be in sorted order to use the binary search algorithm | A binary search is often more efficient than sequential/linear search when applied to sorted data | There are two important ways to search a list | Sequential Search It doesn’t have to be in order | For a Sequential Search you compare each number to the number you are searching for | You can also use this method for strings as well | . | Binary Search While using Binary Search you have to put the group of numbers from ascending or descending order | What the computer does it takes the lowest index and the highest index, adds them and then divides that value by 2 | This gets the middle value and starts the search at the middle of the group | Go to the respective index and pull the element, if this is not the desired number then go to the left and the right to and repeat the same process for the left and the right without including the index of the middle number | To put the efficiency of the binary search method into context if you have a list of 600 numbers the maximum amount of attempts it will take to get the number is 10. (1 level of tree is one search, the algorithm goes to the side of which the number is on the tree) | This method also applies to strings as well because only the indexes are getting compared | As long as the user can put it in an order (preferably alphabetical order) to tell the algorithm which side of the middle index to go to next then it is possible to use | . | . Vocab . Iteration: Repeating steps, or instructions over and over again (this could be also often called a loop) | Selection: is a decision or question. At some point in an algorithm there may need to be a question because the algorithm has reached a step where one or more options are available | Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer. | . Lesson Practice . Here are some notes that I took during the lesson as well as the practice problems . Dice Problem . Do these two algorithms give the same results? . My Answer: No . Explanation: The code is different and it will result in different outputs for specific answers, this is because the the indents are not correct and will run multiple for specific values. Take the number 5 for example, the first algorithm will give you an output of “Nice Roll!” while the second algorithm will actually output two lines, “Nice Roll!” and “Meh… You can do better”. This is because there is nothing telling the code not to run the second line of code, because it is just if statements. . print(&quot;What did you roll on the dice?&quot;) diceRoll = int(input()) if diceRoll &gt;= 4: print(&quot;Nice roll!&quot;) else: if diceRoll &gt;= 2: print(&quot;Meh... You can do better&quot;) else: print(&quot;That was not a great roll!&quot;) . print(&quot;What did you roll on the dice?&quot;) diceRoll = int(input()) if diceRoll &gt;= 4: print(&quot;Nice roll!&quot;) if diceRoll &gt;= 2: print(&quot;Meh... You can do better&quot;) if diceRoll &lt; 2: print(&quot;That was not a great roll!&quot;) . In what instances do the algorithms yield different results for the same input? | . My Answer: When the input is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or greater if the dice has more than 6 sides . Explanation: When you plug these values the code is just doing what it is told, any number that is greater or equal to 2, will have a different output than the first algorithm. We need to find out a way in order for the algorithm to realize what we want it to do. . Why does this happen? | . Explanation: As I have mentioned earlier, this happens because the code is just doing what it is told and nothing is there that is telling the code that it can not work. In order to fix this problem, we can just add like a different domain sort of in the code, so that way if the value is greater than or equal to 2 and less than 4, it will output that line. We need to tell the code to specifically only run certain lines of codes, even if the statement is true. You can look at the code after this section to help you really understand what you really need to do. . Can we adjust the second algorithm to yield the same results? . print(&quot;What did you roll on the dice?&quot;) diceRoll = int(input()) if diceRoll &gt;= 4: print(&quot;Nice roll!&quot;) if diceRoll &gt;= 2 and diceRoll &lt; 4: print(&quot;Meh... You can do better&quot;) if diceRoll &lt; 2: print(&quot;That was not a great roll!&quot;) . Important Takeaways . Small changes/mistakes can have a big impact on the result | You need to make sure the code will work how you want it to | There is often more than one way to achieve the same result | You can add multiple if and else statements in order to make sure you get the result you want | It is very useful to put multiple if statements inside of one another | . Conditional vs Boolean . How could this conditional scenario be replaced with a boolean scenario? . | IF (isHoliday) | { school⟵false | . | } | ELSE | { IF(isWeekday) | { school⟵true | . | } | ELSE | { school⟵false | . | } | . | } | . What needs to be true and what needs to be false in order for you to go to school? . In order for school to be true, the day can not be a holiday nor can it be a weekend. If the day is a holiday, then the code will stop there and you do not need to go to school, but if it is not a holiday, then it will check and see if it is a weekday, and if it is a weekend, then there is no school, but if there it is a weekday and it is not a holiday, then there is school. . First conditional: If isHoliday is true, you do not need to go to school | Second conditional: If isWeekday is true, you do need to go to school. However, if it is false, school also becomes false | . Therefore, in pseudo code, this statement could be written as: . school⟵((NOT (isHoliday)) AND (isWeekday)) | Keep in mind that both of these statements yield the same results, and neither of them are incorrect | . More Comparing Algorithms . The algorithms below are to sum the odd numbers from 1 to 9 (1+3+5+7+9). Do they each work as intended? Yes they both do work as intended because 1+3+5+7+9 is 25, and each code segment will output 25 . sum⟵3 | counter⟵1 | REPEAT 4 TIMES | . sum⟵sum + counter | counter⟵counter + 2 - DISPLAY sum Sum: 25 | . | sum⟵0 | counter⟵9 | REPEAT UNTIL counter &lt; 1 | . sum⟵sum + counter | counter⟵counter - 2 - DISPLAY sum Sum: 25 | . | Why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks? . It is important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks because you can use them in different ways and when coding, it is important to know that your algorithm is not necessarily the correct one, but it could be the most efficient or easy to understand one. . Create an Algorithm . . Code for This Problem . REPEAT UNTIL (goalReached) | { MOVE_FORWARD () | ROTATE_RIGHT () | MOVE_FORWARD () | ROTATE_LEFT () | . | } | . Practice Question .

Practice Problems . Which is a plausable way to pattern your numbers for binary search. . a. [1,4,5,2,3] b. [24,22,23,28,30] c. [5,6,7,8,2] d. [1,2,3,4,5] My Answer: d . | Explanation: When using Binary search, you want to make sure that the numbers in the list is actually in order from least to greatest, and option d is the only list that does this . How many checks would it take to print out 20 using sequential search . [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 20] 7 Checks | . | Explanation: This is because 30 is at the end of the list, and you are using sequential, so you have to inspect each item in the list, and since 20 is the 8th term, it would take 7 checks . How many checks would it take to print out 30 using binary search . [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 30] 5 Checks | . | Explanation: Binary Search starts in the middle of the list and then checks both sides, it will take 5 checks until it finds 30 since it is at the end of the list . Using Binary Search how many checks would it take to find the word kiwi. . [Apple, Banana, Kiwi, Mango, Strawberry] 1 Check | . | Explanation: If using Binary Search, Kiwi is in the middle of the list so it makes it easy to find because it will find Kiwi with one check . Rap . Each group has 2 minutes to write a 3 line rap about what they learned. One volunteer will rap their group’s lines and will receive a reward | . Our Group Rap: . Binary Search has a lot of potential, It is just essential, Way better than sequential, . Hacks . Write this Boolean statement in the form of a conditional (if/else) statement: stayInside⟵((isCold) OR (isRaining)) | print(&quot;Let&#39;s Check to see if we can go outside today&quot;) isCold = True isRaining = True stayInside = [] if (isCold or isRaining) { stayInside = True print(&quot;You Should Stay Inside!&quot;) } else { stayInside = False print(&quot;You Can Go Outside!&quot;) } . Create an algorithm that uses selection and/or iteration that will represent one player’s complete turn. . During a turn, each player gets 4 attempts/chances to get the greatest number possible. . | During each attempt, the player will use a random number generator to select a random number from 1 to 10. . | After they have had 4 chances, their score is the greatest number they received from the random number generator, and their turn is over. . | . | import random attempts = [] i = 1 while i &lt;= 4&quot; attempts.append(random.randint(1,10)) i = i + 1 print(&quot;These Are Your Numbers&quot; + attempts) print(&quot;Highest Roll:&quot; + max(attempts)) . Create an algorithm that will allow the arrow to reach the gray square: finish = false | while finish = false: if canMoveForward = true: moveForward() else: if canMoveRight = true: turnRight() moveForward() if touchingFinish = true: finish = true break() . I used a while loop so that it will keep running until it finishes and then if the robot is touching the finish line then the code will stop. It will move forward until it hits the black block and then it will turn right and move forward, until it hits the edge so it will run through the if statement again and turn right. . Make a binary search tree of different the list [1,2,3,4,6,9,11,69] | . Explain thoroughly how to find the number 69 in the list above (use key words) | We can check the number and search for 69 in the array by splitting it. You need to index the list and find the middle value of it, since the number of items in the list is even, so the middle number would be 6 which would still be less than 69. This means that we have to keep looking at the right and left side of the list. After 3 more searches, you can finally find the value 69. Otherwise you can use sequential search which would take longer because you are looking all the way at the beginning at the list and 69 is at the end. . Make a diagram explaining how you found the list (not tree, include equation) . | Put this list of strings in a order that can be used for binary search [“store”,”Market”,”Walmart”,Target”,”Ralphs”] . | search [“Market”, “Ralphs”, “store”, “Walmart”, “Target”] . You can use Binary Search for this list and then use it, I am not really sure if I did it right, but this seemed to make the most logical sense. I chose this because they are all markets, but market and ralphs are really for produce, but at target and walmart, they are more like retail stores. . Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search | Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search because it allows us to index through lists much more efficiently and it allows us to be able to find out and search for items much more quicker. Binary Search helps us to search exponentially while sequential search moves through a list one by one. Binary Search actually is able to index through half the list every single iteration, so it is much more quicker. Binary Search can save a lot of time compared to Sequential Search. . [64,36,16,11,9] Explain which number you are finding, how many check it would take, and make a binary search tree | I am going to choose to find the number 9 which is at the end of the list, but if using binary search, it should only take us two checks. I think this list should work without any reordering because it is from highest to lowest, and usually I do lowest to highest, but if doing code we should switch the &gt; to a &lt; so the code knows where to search. .",

Lists are a collection of data in a sequence that is an iterable | Each sequence is demarcated with an index, starting from 0. This is known as base 0 indexing | .pop edits the end of the list | for and while loops can be used to iterate over loops | cant go over the number of indices in the index | Iteration does a repetition of a process | A List is a collection of data in a sequence that is iterable | i is the number of times something is repeated | pop removes the last item from a list | base 0 indexing is when you start from 0 | A while loop is an over bound interval by comparing it to a conditional | . Vocabulary . Iteration - Repetition of a Process . For Loop - FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated . While Loop - The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met . Initialization - What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0. . Condition - Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop. . Increment/Decrement - Modifies the counter variable after each repetition. . Indexing / List Index - The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 . Nesting - Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops. . Array - Another name for a list, depends on the language . What you need to do . Exercises . Complete the exercises and add screenshots of your completed code to your blog Reflect on what you learned | . | Exercise 1 . This exercise was pretty simple and I just used list.reverse, but the instructions asked us to do it with iteration, so I used a for loop and made it run for every value inside the list. The code that I used here was really simple, and all I did was take the original list and then reverse it into a new list and then print that. . This is probably the right way to do it, I did this with a for loop and was able to use it to run the code and make it add it’s value for each one in the list. By using a for loop here, I was able to actually fufill the iteration requirement and able to print the reverse order. However, I am not sure if we were supposed to print each number on a separate line, but I could not figure that out. I assume we would use a for loop function and then print something like i, it would be interesting to find out how to do this, and see if I was close. . Exercise 2 . This was definitely the hardest problem or exercise that I had to do, even harder than the quiz. I couldn’t complete it so I moved to the quiz, so yeah this exercise was quite hard. I was not sure what was meant by bubble sorting. I decided to do a quick google search and this was good because after looking at it, I remembered I saw something similar in the lesson for Section 10 about Lists. . Multiple Choice Quiz . Complete the quiz and add screenshots of the questions you got wrong to your blog Reflect on what you learned | If you got everything correct, look at the javascript code used to create the quiz and explain how the use of lists and iteration helps to make the code more efficient | . | . Corrections . I got Question #10 on the quiz because I wasn’t exactly sure how many for loops we needed to use, but I knew that we needed to use a for loop because. There was 3 lists in the list, so I thought we could just use one for loop in order to iterate through. I believe that using one for loop would work but be less efficient, I think that by using 2 for loops it iterates through the lists much faster. . Reflection . I felt like I knew everything from the quiz and could answer every question. I just had a little bit of a problem with Question 10. I was not sure how many loops are exactly needed to iterate through the lists efficiently. Overall, I felt that the quiz was pretty easy and everything that was in the quiz was covered during the lesson . JavaScript Code . When I first clicked on the quiz, I was really impressed with the UI. I really liked the UI and liked that it looked so nice. I think whoever made this quiz did a really good job with the UI and made it really friendly to work with, and the other effects also impressed me. I thought that this would have taken a lot of code, but after clicking on it, I realized that was not the case. The code was way more simpler and shorter than I initially thought. I noticed that they just made a function for the questions and then used a for loop to display it making it a lot more easier than having to type out each question in each cell. The Lists and Iteration both help to simplify this code a lot, and it also makes it easier for anyone trying to understand what was going on, the code was not too overwhelming, so it was easy to understand. .

True | B. False | . My Answer: False . Explanation: The Binary number is 8, which is not equal to 90 . 1000 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 8 = 8 . 2. 10(D) ≠ 0110(B) . A. True | B. False | . My Answer: True . Explanation: This is true because the binary number is 6, which is not equal to 10, this is exactly what the statement is saying and is not equal to each other . 0110 = 0 + 2 + 4 + 0 = 6 . 3. 56(D) ≥ 111000(B) . A. True | B. False | . My Answer: True . Explanation: The answer to this question is true because when you find the number of the binary, it becomes 56 and that means that statement is true. The operator in the middle is greater than or equal to, and 56 is equal to 56 . 111000 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 16 + 32 = 56 . 3. 99(D) &lt; 1110011(B) . A. True | B. False | . My Answer: True . Explanation: This is true because when you find the binary&#39;s value in decimal, you get a value of 115. The operator here is less than, and 99 is less than 115 and the statement becomes true. . 1110011 = 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 115 . Now, complete the binary truth tables .

If Ben has a full tank of car fuel, then he will go to the bank, if that statement is false, then he will go home. Once he gets to the bank, it is another if-else statement because it depends if his account has money in it. If it does not have $1000 or higher, he will not deposit money, but if he does, he will deposit money. . 4. What would be most appropriate for this situation? Luke wants to play basketball.

            "content": "Taking the Multiple Choice Test . I wanted to take the test over the weekend, but I did not get the time too. When I got to class on Monday, two of my groupmates had already finished it, so I decided to work with Jishnu. The questions were not too hard, but we spent a lot of time collaborating and explaining our answers to make sure the other one got it. We did this until Question 20, and I finished the rest by myself. I did this pretty quickly and finished quicker than expected and when I submitted I got a 43/50. . Test Corrections . After I submitted the test, I got a 43/50 (86%), which was around what I thought I would get. I was hoping to get an A, but I guess this means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills. . 1.D: 1/2 (50.0%) . 2.B: 5/7 (71.4%) . 3.A: 7/8 (87.5%) . 3.C: 3/4 (75.0%) . 4.A: 4/6 (66.7%) . I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don’t understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right. . Question 6 . Topic 1.3: Program Design and Development . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option D Incorrect. The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so only values less than or equal to max are printed. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option B Correct. The procedure initializes count to 1. Inside the loop, the value of count is displayed, then count is incremented by 2 to the next odd integer. The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so all positive odd integers less than or equal to max are printed. . . Reflection: This question was hard and I was not really sure how to interpret the code. I was not exactly sure of the value of the variable max and I did not really know how to solve it. I remember asking Jishnu about this problem, and I had no idea how to do it. . Question 11 . Topic 1.2: Program Function and Purpose . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option D Incorrect. The inner loop iterates from index j + 1 to the end of the list, so each element is compared with all the elements that follow it, not just the one element that immediately precedes it. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option B Correct. The algorithm traverses myList using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from the first element in the list to the second-to-last element in the list. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop compares that element to every subsequent element in the array. . . Reflection: This question was also very confusing as I did not know how to do it. I was not sure how to read the code, and I am not sure what it means by subsequent and preceding. I got the wrong answer, but it seemed close to the right answer so that was good. . Question 20 . Topic 2.1: Binary Numbers . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option B Incorrect. Four bits can represent 24, or 16 pieces of information, so it is not necessary to add extra bits. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option D Correct. Four bits can represent 24, or 16 pieces of information. . . Reflection: We did not really talk about Binary Numbers in class, so I had help from Jishnu because he knew a little bit about it. For this questions, I did not know what a bit was and how it was needed to store directions. . Question 21 . Topic 2.1: Binary Numbers . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option A Incorrect. Statement II is true because colors can be encoded as sequences of bits. Statement III is true because sequences of bits can be used to represent sound. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option D Correct. All digital data is represented at the lowest level as sequences of bits. Statement I is true because strings of characters can be represented by sequences of bits. Statement II is true because colors can be encoded as sequences of bits. Statement III is true because sequences of bits can be used to represent sound. . . Reflection: Just like the last question, we did not do Binary Numbers in class so I wasn’t sure about it. I did not know you can use binary to represent strings, colors, and audio, but I think that makes sense now. . Question 36 . Topic 3.10: Lists . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option D Incorrect. This would be the correct solution if i were initialized to 0 instead of 1. This code segment will generate the list [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option C Correct. For the first iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 2, is appended to evenList, and then i is incremented to 2. For the second iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 4, is appended to the list, and then i is incremented to 3. This continues eight more times, appending the next eight even numbers to evenList. This code segment will generate the list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]. . . Reflection: I was not sure how the order matters in this question, and I am still a little confused by it, but it makes a little more sense to me now because you should define the variable before running the code with the variable. . Question 37 . Topic 3.3: Mathematical Expressions . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option A Incorrect. A temporary variable is needed to interchange the values of two variables. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option D Correct. The first statement assigns the value of num1 to the temporary variable temp. The second statement assigns the value of num2 to num1. The third statement assigns the original value of num1, which is stored in temp, to num2. The original values of num1 to num2 are interchanged. . . Reflection: The question wanted to interchange the variables so I thought that switching them would be enough, but I didn’t realize that num1 is changed to num2, so when the second line of code is ran, num2 stays the same. . Question 39 . Topic 3.2: Data Abstraction . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option C Incorrect. List indices are typically nonnegative integers, so a decimal number between two integers would be considered an invalid index. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option D Correct. List indices are typically nonnegative integers. The exam reference sheet describes a list structure whose index values are 1 through the number of elements in the list, inclusive. So, 4 would be considered a valid index. . . Reflection: I was not sure how to answer this question at all, we did not do the videos for this CollegeBoard Big Idea, but we still went over it in class, and I was not sure what a valid index was, so I guessed on this question. . Confusing Problems . These are some problems that I was not sure how to do and I needed help to understand it. I did not really understand what the question was asking or how to answer it. I just chose what I thought was the best answer, and it was correct. . Question 2 . This question was really hard and I did not really know what to do. I do not know how I got this answer correct because I had no idea what it meant by procedure or mystery. I just followed the code on the inside and chose my answer, and it turned out to be right. . Question 9 . I still do not really understand this question, but I did understand that you need to change the lines for the code to work properly. When answering this question, I did not know what to do and Jishnu said to pick number 3 and explained it to me. . Question 44 . This question was a little hard mainly because I did not know what MOD was, so I had to look it up to find out it was the remainder which was not that hard. . Reflection on the Exam . Overall, the test was pretty easy and I think I could have received a higher score if I paid attention a little more. I think I went through this test pretty quickly when I did it by myself, but when I was talking with Jishnu, that took a lot of time because he was explaining some answers to me. I think I can do well on the AP Exam if I find out what exactly I need to do and keep reviewing the content. I got a 3/3. .",

            "content": "Background . Our Night at the Museum was on November 3rd, 2022, at 6:00pm-7:30pm. I had to take a 30 minute shift with the rest of my group and help explain our group project. We are in Period 4 with Mr. Mortensen so we had We had two laptops on display so that way we could present to more people easier. Our Project was a calendar and we used a frontend and a backend for it. Our backend was where we had to store our data for the calendar and then we had to show it on our frontend, and in order to get the data from the backend, we had to use fetch commands to get the data to show and save our calendar. I was a Frontend Developer so I worked a lot on the frontend and making it look nice. . Presenting our Flask Site . Backend We did not really present our backend site, the main purpose of the site was to have it run and use it as a place to store the data that the frontend had. In order to use the backend, we had to get off the School Wifi because it had the firewall which blocked AWS which was the host we used for the backend. We quickly went over this site if there were any people who wanted to know more about our project and how we did it. . Presenting our Fastpage Site . Frontend This was the site we used mainly for our users to interact with. If you go to the website you can use our project and see what exactly what the users do. You can also go on the website to try it out. We got a lot of people to try out our calendar, and my favorite people that came were these two parents who asked us a lot about our calendar really testing our knowledge. I had a lot of fun explaining our project to other people. . Looking at other Projects . After 6:30, we could go, but I brought my sister with me and she wanted to see the art and other projects. We first looked at other computer science projects and used them, but after that we went to other classes such as Ceramics, 3D Animation, and AP Studio Art. . Regarding AP Computer Science I looked at many projects even from Computer Science A. I liked to see how all the students in AP Computer Science A were working as well as their thought process. I took a picture of two people’s projects, Jonathan Wu (APCSP) and William Wu (APCSA). . Jonathan and his group’s project was about Jeopardy but on the night of the museum, they did not really have a frontend, so he just showed me the code, but they could not really get Jeopardy to work . William and his group’s project was really interesting and they had a lot of work done. They did a project about crimes with multiple pieces of information attached to it. I really liked their site and they had so many features and a lot of pages. I think they did a lot of work and really showed they knew what they were doing. I listened to them present it and I was very impressed because they had so much information. . After a couple of computer science projects, my sister wanted to go to the other classes, especially AP Studio Art. This was the class we spent the most time in after Computer Science. I even saw an old elementary school teacher that I talked to for a bit, so that was nice. My sister really seemed to enjoy this class and told me she wanted to take it. After this we looked a bit at Ceramics but mainly looked at 3D Computer Animation after that. I pulled up my work from 2 years ago, and I was amazed how different my project was compared to everyone’s that was displayed. Mine was just the basics and what was required, but so many people went above and beyond and I was amazed by this. .",

Input In [4] &lt;!-- HTML table fragment for page --&gt; ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . This code is about HTML and it builds a table and you need the part in the beginning because it is put into a JavaScript Cell, but needs to be HTML in order to properly build the table and really show what exactly it needs to do in order to make the table. This really just sets up the code for the table so later the segments can format the data and help it ot understand what exactly is going on. . &lt; table &gt; makes a table, &lt; tr &gt; makes a row, &lt; th &gt; makes a column header, and &lt; thead &gt; is tag for the group header, and &lt; tbody &gt; is a tag used later to define an element id . &lt;!-- HTML table fragment for page --&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;All-time Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Recorded Deaths&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Active Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;time&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;total_cases&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;total_deaths&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;active_cases&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;All-time Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Recorded Deaths&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Active Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody id=&quot;result&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- generated rows --&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; . This part of the code basically just preparing the code and the table before the code actually fetches the API and outputs it as well as formats it. It is basically just a sequence. I do not know exactly what each line of code does, but I thin this whole cell is just making the headers for the table so later segments of code can reference it and use it to make a table. . &lt;!-- Script is layed out in a sequence (no function) and will execute when page is loaded --&gt; &lt;script&gt; // prepare HTML result container for new output const resultContainer = document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;); // prepare fetch options const url = &quot;https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/covid/&quot;; const headers = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;default&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;omit&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39; // &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#39;, }, }; . I think this is the base code and the main part of the program that really shows what is going on and really explains what and how the API is being formatted. First it will fetch the API, and then it will organize it into headers. Before proceeding it checks for any errors and if there are no errors then it will probably run the top part with the if statement. After that it will take the data from the API and start the organization process. This also puts data and data.world_total in the console log. It also takes each specific part of the API and chooses how to format it. It grabs specific parts of the data and this helps the code to realize where specifically the code goes in the table and what exactly to do with it. Also for each time the code makes a row depending on the data, it sends the message row to the console. The last part kind of appends some child nodes so that way it follows a specific data system and puts the information of each cell along the rows. . // fetch the API fetch(url, headers) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors if (response.status !== 200) { const errorMsg = &#39;Database response error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = errorMsg; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); return; } // valid response will have json data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); console.log(data.world_total) // World Data document.getElementById(&quot;time&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.statistic_taken_at; document.getElementById(&quot;total_cases&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.total_cases; document.getElementById(&quot;total_deaths&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.total_deaths; document.getElementById(&quot;active_cases&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.active_cases; // Country data for (const row of data.countries_stat) { console.log(row); // tr for each row const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); // td for each column const name = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const cases = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const deaths = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const active = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); // data is specific to the API name.innerHTML = row.country_name; cases.innerHTML = row.cases; deaths.innerHTML = row.deaths; active.innerHTML = row.active_cases; // this builds td&#39;s into tr tr.appendChild(name); tr.appendChild(cases); tr.appendChild(deaths); tr.appendChild(active); // add HTML to container resultContainer.appendChild(tr); } }) }) . I think this code just tries to refetch the API if something does not work. I am not completely sure, but my best guess is that it just uses that and then creates elements based on what it has in the API. It will make a constant number of rows and cells to format the data into. . // catch fetch errors (ie ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { console.error(err); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = err; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); }); &lt;/script&gt;KeyboardEvent .",

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data.

            "content": "What standards have we hit so far? Which assignment do they relate to? . We have finished videos from Big Idea 1 and started some of Big Idea 4. We have hit a lot of standards from this video. Additionally, we have also done a lot of standards seen with all the activities we are doing, so that means we can actually learn a lot and are preparing a lot for the AP Exam. I can reference all the activities we did with the APCSP website, because each activity is posted with tags corresponding to which standards they relate to. . What standards are you looking forward to learning more about? . I am looking forward to learning more about web development and how it can be customized. I also want to learn more about how the Internet processes and sends data, even though we learned a little about it in Big Idea 4. I think it would be interesting to watch the rest of the videos for Big Idea 4. This would be really important because I can learn so much about it and if I finish all the CollegeBoard Videos by the AP Exam, I can just review my notes instead of having to watch the videos all over again. . What other careers can you benefit from being in this pathway? . I can benefit from so many other Careers in the STEM field. The STEM Field is a huge field with so many different job opportunities and wide variety of activities. I have heard from many people that taking this class helps build skills that many jobs use such as web development which can be used by software engineers or business owners. Also, another skill learned from this class can be collaboration which helps in so many different fields as this is an important skill to have for any job. .",

            "content": "Intro to Engineering at Qualcomm . On October 17, 2022, the WE STEM Club came to Del Norte and offered students in AP Computer Science Classes and other classes an opportunity to listen to the experiences of multiple Qualcomm Employees. These talks were split into two different parts and one talk was on Monday and the other on Tuesday. The talk on Monday was about Intro to Engineering at Qualcomm with Sumalatha Arugolana (Staff Engineer) and Nisha Sethia (Director of Engineering). On Tuesday, the second part of the talk was about Intersections of Business and STEM at Qualcomm with Sreeja Nair (Director of Product Management) and Lindsey Kostas (Staff Machine Learning Engineer). . Sumalatha Arugolana’s Talk . She was inspired by her mother and really gained interest in engineering | She was taught by her mother about math and science before school | She chose engineering because she was inspired by her mother and after college she was able to have a career in Engineering | After finding out what each stream of engineering did, she tried really hard and chose the one she liked the most | She is a Communications Engineer | Her College Experience | Qualcomm wants to bring new technologies to other fields such as automobiles | She works with mobile phones | Engineering is a Team Effort | She takes a lot of breaks from her work such as playing Tennis | She is not always in front of the laptop always and takes a lot of breaks from work | Did not take any college classes in America, only in India | . Nisha Sethia’s Talk . She was really inspired by her father and seeing all the things that he did | Girls were not taken that seriously for a STEM Major | She was very confused and did not know what major to do | She looked around and wanted to see why people chose the majors that they did and she reflected on herself asking what she wanted to do | When she graduated, the cellphone industry was not very big and she did not really know much about it | She was really curious about how the wireless phones worked and how they were able to function | After seeing, these phones she was really passionate about this field and really wanted to learn more about it so she started building 2G Phones | Felt the entire process was new to her | She gained a lot of interest in this field of mobile technologies and has not looked back | She made a goal to learn the system end to end | She joined Qualcomm in early 2010’s and helped to work on the 4G Phones | Today she works on the 5G Phones | To choose which field of engineering you want, keep a growth mindset and it may feel hard but try and get exposed to it and find which parts are your majors | Did not take any college classes in America, only in India | . Insights . After listening to this talk, I think it is very important to not compare yourself to others and that you should always stay curious. One of the questions was which field of engineering should I take, and this was a question that I find myself asking. Right now I want to become a Mechanical Engineering but there are so many options in Engineering. A way to find out which field of engineering is to find new experiences. Knowing there are a lot of fields I think I have narrowed it down to software engineering, hardware engineering, or mechanical engineering, but within those fields there are still a lot of different options. I have tried to expose myself a bit more especially by trying to do a lot of different STEM options like Robotics where I have tried doing Electrical and I am also doing AP Computer Science Principles and am quite interested in that as well. One of the speaker’s sons was challenging himself and majored in Mechanical Engineering. I now want to challenge myself more and participate in more STEM related classes and learn more about the process of Engineering. Getting more exposure to Engineering in High School is really important and it is important to learn all these concepts early on so classes will be easier in the future. . Takeaways . This talk has helped me a lot to realize what I need to do if I really want to go into the Engineering field. This talk has really shown me that I need to take all the challenges I have and the opportunities related to Engineering. I need to show more interest in STEM fields because I am really interested and I need to narrow down the STEM major I want to choose. I am in Robotics but I think I need to participate in Robotics more and make sure I am getting as much exposure as I can. I also think I should really use this Summer to my advantage and try to get more Experiences in the STEM field. .",

The Internet has been around for a while and there are many aspects to it like computing and the hardware. Computers used to be very big and people working that working with a big computer did not want to be alone so the internet was made. CSN - 1.A.1 defines a computing device as a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors. CSN - 1.A.3 says that a computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data. Also CSN - 1.A.7 says that the bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time. CSN - 1.B.1 says that the Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open nonproprietary communication protocols. CSN - 1.C.1 says that information is passed through the Internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets. . CollegeBoard Videos 4.1 Videos 1 and 2 . Video 1: . Computers were really big and they were not very portable and this means that they could not really work with a lot of people | Working with big computers meant not much collaboration so people had the idea of the internet | At the time, computers were big because they needed the size for the hardware such as storage size and computers at the time had small storage | Routers are actually computing devices and they push information | Computers are capable of sending and receiving data | A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network and each packet includes the source and the destination and can be sent | Packets are sent from a computer system or a computer network | A Computer System is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a joint purpose | A Computer Network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data | When you have a computer system, you need a computer network | A computer will take a packet and divide into smaller pieces and then they are sent along multiple different paths and don’t have to be in order | A router helps guide a packet and direct it towards where it is going | Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver. = Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time on a computer network, measured in bits per second | . Video 2: . There are four levels, Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access | There are many different protocols, standards, data formats, used at the Application and Transport layers | Application: HTTP and DNS, how the user is able to connect to the Internet | Network: Focuses on Hardware and the most access network access protocol is Ethernet | Network Access: Data Link, Fiber, MAC, Ethernet, NIC, and Wire and | Internet: IP Address and was designed to be scalable, meaning it can change size when there is a lot of information | Transport: Has TCP and UCP, and TCP does error checking and error recovery so it is slower and UDP performs error checking but not for packets | Intranet is LANs connected by Routers | Local Area Networks (LAN’s) are physical connections and can be limited by hardware and physics | DNS is the Domain Name Service and they are applications that translate a human readable URL to a IP Address | . CollegeBoard Quiz: The Internet Quiz . I took the CollegeBoard quiz about the Internet and out of the 3 questions, I got 2 of the questions right showing that I mostly understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make myself a better developer and understand what errors happened and how to fix them. I got the 3rd question wrong and this question was asking the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet. I understand now and I was just a little confused on the definitions . Takeaways . Computers are used by people all the time, but computers were large so that means that they were not that portable so in order to communicate with others, the internet was made so computers could communicate with each other. Today, many people have access to the Internet, and in order to connect they need a computing device to send and receive data. This is usually the router which many people have that help them to connect to the internet. Data is sent over a network in packets which has data and tells routers where it is from and where it is going. People use the internet to send data all the time and it makes it easier to learn and communicate with others on the Internet. . Model . .",

Errors in programming happen all the time but many people have a very hard time understanding what errors there are and how to solve them. Understanding the different errors is essential to becoming a proficient programmer. CRD - 2.I.1 says that a logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly. CRD 2.I.2 says that a syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of programming language are not followed. CRD - 2.I.5 says that test cases, hand tracing, visualizations, debuggers, and adding extra output statements are effective ways to find and correct errors. CRD - 2.J.2 is defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate the different expected outcomes that are at or just beyond the extremes of input data. . CollegeBoard Videos 1.4 Videos 1, 2, and 3 . Video 1: . There are 4 types of errors, a logic error, a syntax error, a run-time error, and an overflow error | Programmers that are proficient should be able to notice all three types of errors | Logic Error: Caused by the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm which causes the program to behave unexpectedly | Syntax Error: A mistake when a programmer makes a typo or writes some code or forgets to write code, or maybe wrote code that doesn’t follow the program’s language rules and cause the program to fail | Run-Time Error: This causes the program to fail while running and is commonly known as a bug and to identify it, the program runs initially but fails and can’t complete its processes | Overflow Error: An overflow error is when a program is required to perform a calculation that is outside of defined range of values. Due to memory allocation constraints that programming languages require, certain values are too big to calculate or display. | . Video 2: . The easiest error to identify is usually the syntax error | Most IDE’s display information when there is no syntax error | The error usually shows where the error happened and tells people what to fix | Logic Errors are hard to find and correct which are not always noticed all the time and using test cases is the first strategy programmers use to find logic errors | A logic error is immediately noticed and using test cases is the first strategy programmers use to find logic errors | Hand tracing is another strategy and is useful with iteration or loops | Hand tracing can be useful for small code segments and loops that iterate a small number of times | Hand tracing can show that the algorithm was actually just displaying the last time a number was less than number after the list | Visualizations show graphs, images, color, and etc that can help determine if a program is working correctly | Debuggers use software designed to run a program allowing it to be paused and tested in the midst of running to determine if it is working properly | . Video 3: . Developers must start testing the program and need to think about it | The program specifications list the behaviors, events, and corresponding reponses/outputs the program is to support | Programmers need to define inputs that will determine whether or not the specifications are met | Once inputs and corresponding outputs are determined, programmers test, test, and test | After testing, programmers use the results the revise, refine, and improve their programs | Programmers have to test a program many times to make sure that everything is working | Programmers have to test and then the users have to test and then the programmers change even more | After a lot of testing, the program is finally released to other people | . CollegeBoard Quiz: Identifying and Correcting Errors Quiz . I took the CollegeBoard quiz about Identifying and Correcting Errors and out of the 3 questions, I got 3 of the questions right showing that I understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make myself a better developer and understand what errors happened and how to fix them. This quiz was a little hard especially on the first question because I did not really know how to do it, and I was between two answers, but now I understand it. . Takeaways . Developers face errors all the time and they need to make sure that they have to test a program a lot. There are many types of different errors like the logic error, syntax error, run-time error, and the overflow error. They have to test the program as much as they can and they test it and then get some users to test the program and find errors. When you get an error, there are many changes you can make, and the first step is to identify what the error is and how to solve it. The process of code is long and they need to make sure that everything is working. There are many ways to solve an error and one of them is hand tracing and you can use that to improve your code. .",

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. . In the Nighthawk Coders APCSP you can find an Overview and Examples using APIs:APCSP APIs menu- Using Covid RapidAPI JavaScript frontend API code in APCSP Fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-rapidapi.md | . | Making a Jokes API (this will next API tech talk) Frontend.

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. . RapidAPI- Google Developer I used an API from RapidAPI and this helped me and I used Currencies and it listed it Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). | .",

Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? I did not know how to use the string | When I typed stop the code always broke | When I typed burger it did not work and ran the else statement | The break crashed the system | . | What are some test cases that can be used? inputting burger and getting the price of burger | adding items to the list and seeing if the total is right | Putting stop to see if the program outputs the right items | . | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. The code was always running the else part so I had to fix my indentation | Whenever I typed something on the menu, it would run the else statement, so I had to add elif to the functions above | . | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project?

There is a lot of development that has to go into programs to make the user interactions easier. CRD - 2.E.1 says that a development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. CRD 2.E.2 says that there are multiple development processes. the following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, and testing. CRD 2.F.3 also says that some ways investigation can be performed are with collecting data through surveys, user testing, interviews, and direct observations. CRD - 2.H.1 says that it is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. CRD - 2.G.2 says that comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not how a program runs. . CollegeBoard Videos 1.3 Videos 1, 2, and 3 . Video 1: . A program is always developed with an idea | The idea always has a specific purpose in the mind and the people think about what they want to do and follow some steps | Developers are trying to stick to their plan and follow some specific steps | The Development can be very exploratory and the steps followed are based on what happens, people who are observing early AI Projects look for things to improve on and they try to make changes that might be useful | When making a program, developers have to determine the requirements of the program, understand the constraints like time, understand the user concerns and interests | Developers design the program by brainstorming, storyboarding, planning user experience, laying out the user interface, organizing into modules, and develop a testing strategy | Developers have to choose how a program should behave and include a list of user interactions | . Video 2: . Programs are developed by groups of people and groups use programming from other people and make it for themselves, but they must give credit | Different people or teams work on different components and they all work together as a team | When working in a team, credit must be given to people who were a part of the program, and documentation helps when fixing things and so that person gets credit | The program documentation should include the author’s name and the source of the code segments used | . Video 3: . Comments are used by Developers all the time to tell themselves what their code does and tell collaborators how their code works | In comments, they will describe the program, list program specifications, describe the program, and the list of contributors and authors | The developers will list the specifications of the program like the purpose | Developers keep track of the process while programming | After they are done, they should be able to explain the process | Comments can help the efficiency of programming, and help programmers to find bugs or understand what each piece of code says | To comment in Python, you need to put a # | To comment in Java, you need to put a //, /* Comments/, /** Documentation/ | To comment in HTML, you need to put &lt; !–Comment–&gt; | To comment in AppleScript, you need to (* Comment*) | To comment in Scratch or AppInventor, you can add comments to each block and can be shown when wanted | . CollegeBoard Quiz: Collaboration Quiz . I took the CollegeBoard quiz about Collaboration and out of the 3 questions, I got 3 of the questions right showing that I understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make collaborating with my group more efficient. I can use what I learned to make sure I am a better collaborator. I can add more comments to my code to help my group mates understand what I am trying to do. I can also add comments to my fastpage, so anyone looking at my code can see what I did. . Takeaways . There is a specific purpose for Developers when they are making a program and they have to do a lot of things. They also need to think about a lot and what they can add or change. They also need to do a lot of testing. Developers make a lot of additions based on feedback or they thought of improving something. Developers have to work in groups and they often work in small groups of large groups. They will all work on specific areas and then they will add comments to see what each program does. Documentation is very important for developers especially when they are in a team, so others can understand what is going on and credit can also be given to people. .",

For this project, I personally used W3Schools a little bit . W3Schools - reference | . console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | I used Console.log in my AppLab | Whenever a button was clicked I would log it in the console | . console.log(&quot;Hello World!&quot;); . Hello World! . console.log(&quot;This is Edwin trying out the console.log command&quot;) . This is Edwin trying out the console.log command . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. During the CollegeBoard Daily Videos for Unit 1.2, I learned what a sequence of code was . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // This defines the variable &quot;msg&quot; and then prints it later with console.log console.log(msg); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function | . | . I noticed that you need to run previous codes because that is the only way the variable is defined. . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely Typed Language . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. similar to Python and most interpretive languages. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2024); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List .

CRD - 2.A.2 is an understanding of the purpose of a computing innovations provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation. CRD - 2.C.1 says that program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. CRD - 2.D.1 says that program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. Also, CRD - 2.B.1 says that a program is a collection of program statements that perform s a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software. . CollegeBoard Videos 1.2 Videos 1, 2, and 3 . Video 1: . There are many computing innovations in the world that people use everyday | There are so many things that people use everyday | People use computing innovations all the time such as with online shopping and communication like email or smartphones | Social Media allows people to communicate with others online | E-Commerce is online shopping and helps you to save time and money because you can get products from your home | Digital Assistant Devices are helpful because they can do things automatically, and it can help save energy and time | .

Video 3: . A program is a collection of statements, which is a single command | A group of statements is called a code segment | A program is often referred to as software | Code Segments need to work for a variety of different lists, like lists that include numbers out of order, negative numbers, large numbers, or decimals | Descriptions of programs should have comments and should say what it does to help others and yourself, it can explain why in detail it works | . CollegeBoard Quiz: Collaboration Quiz . I took the CollegeBoard quiz about Collaboration and out of the 6 questions, I got 4 of the questions right showing that I somewhat understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make collaborating with my group more efficient. I got question 4 and 6 wrong, but for question 4, I did not really look at one of the statements, so I think I should’ve have gotten that right, but for Question 6, I did not know how to read the code. . Takeaways . I have learned that are there are so many different functions when using a program and that can really help people in their daily lives. I also learned that there are many different types of input, and based on what your input is, the output can change, and events can happen based on actions. There are many different types of computing innovation in our lives, and I should try to innovate on any inventions to help people.

I really hope to learn as much as I can from this class so that in my future, I can continue developing these skills and use them for various actions. . One big thing that would be really helpful would be to update my Timebox each week so that way when it is time for the AP Exam, I can look at it and remember any important topics I need to study from that. . I also hope to do really well on the College Board Quizzes and try on them to see what I really need to go back and review.

Takeaways . I have learned that Collaboration is a huge part of many different jobs. It does not matter if you are working in a field that is not computer science, collaboration is important to everyone and helps connect things to make one big thing. For example, the way many apps look how they look is because of collaboration, one person can not really do all that so many people from different areas share ideas to make a product that users will enjoy. On the apple website, they need software engineers to program the cool transitions, but they also need artists to design the product so that the programmers can animate it. .",

            "title": "App Lab",
            "content": "Code.org AppLab . We were told to design an app using Code.org with an App Lab. I opened the App Lab and then went to the design tab and added a button to start the quiz. This picture below shows what the window looked like and by the end of this app, I hope it looks much better . My Plan for this AppLab is to make a Quiz about Technology with 4 Questions and I want them to be able to have multiple attempts to get the question right and that way they can for sure get a 100% on the quiz. . Final Draft . AppLab Part 1 - The Design of Homepage and Instruction . I also made a new screen for the rules and how to play page and I added code to make sure when the button was clicked it would switch to the rules and how to play the quiz. Here is a picture of what my homepage looks like . This is a picture of what my instruction page looks like and i used the same code as I did for the first button, I just changed it a little bit to make sure the code detected the right button. . The Designing and Coding of Question 1 . I started to make the questions and the first one would be about who the CEO of Google was and of course that is Sundar Pichai. I made it so that you had to click on the picture to respond. Here is a picture of what the first question looks like and whenever the user clicks on the wrong image, it will tell them that it is wrong and allow them to answer it again. . If the user clicked on the image of Jeff Bezos or anyone else it would send them to this screen . If the user clicked on the image of Sundar Pichai it would send them to this screen . My First Challenge . I have encountered one of my first issues and I have been told that I need to have a score at the end of my quiz, so I plan on just not allowing the users to redo the questions and just letting them have one chance and using variables at the end to tell the user the score. This does help me because this way, I do not have to make separate buttons for each time the user gets a question wrong to send them to next question, but I do have to make more screens, but I will make them look the same. . Designing and Coding of Question 2 . For question 2, I decided to ask a question about Samsung’s new folding smartphones and see if any users actually know about these phones and how Samsung has been able to make their displays foldable. The point of this question is to make users find out about these products and see if they are interested in it. This is what Question 2 looks like when done designing. . I also made the new screens if the user got the question wrong. . For the coding part of the quiz, I decided to use what I did for Question 2 and whenever a button is clicked, if that response is right it will tell them they got it right, but if the response is wrong, it will tell them they got it wrong. I decided to add a variable at the beginning called score. . The Coding Part was really simple, all I did were add 6 blocks and write what to do when the user clicked one of the buttons, here is what the code looked like. . I do want to add the variables for my score but I want to do that later at the end, right now I want to make sure my code actually works. . Designing and Coding of Question 3 . For question 3, I am going to ask a question about electric cars and see if the user knows which one of the cars has the fastest 0-60 mph, and you can actually buy right now today. . After Designing question 3, this is what the questions looks like, there are 4 options, a Tesla Model S Plaid, a Lucid Air Dream Edition, a Rivian R1S, and a Ford Mustang Mach-E. The correct answer will be the Tesla Model S Plaid. . The code is the same for the other two questions and just tells it what to do after a button has been clicked. . Designing and Coding of Question 4 . I did what I made for the previous questions but this time I wanted to focus on Audio and let users see all the different headphone designs by different companies to see what interested them. After finishing designing this Question, this is what it looked like. . Designing and Coding the End with Score . For this part, I decided to design the page by thanking the users for taking my quiz. Also I decided to take the total score of the quiz the user took and let them know what their score was at the end of the quiz. I did this by adding variables and making sure that in the text box at the end the variable score would be shown. . In order to tell the user their score I had to use the variable I had at the end, so I added code to add a point each time the user got a question right, and if they got it wrong the variable would stay the same. Here is a picture of the code that I added for each question. . This tells the user what their score will be at the end of the quiz out of 4. . My Second Challenge . I finished putting all the variable blocks for each one and I tested it, I got one question wrong but at the end of the quiz, this is that image I saw. . In the image, the text box is blank and that means the user does not know their score so I had to try and fix that. In order to fix this, I looked at someone else’s code and found out that I was using the wrong block of code. After looking at someone else’s code, I realized that I was using the wrong block and found out that I was actually defining the variable each time instead of setting the variable to a number. . I found out the right block of code and that basically allowed the variable to be set to the actual score and that variable was kept throughout the whole quiz. This way when I set the text to the actual variable, the key value would show what the user’s score on the quiz was. .",

            "title": "The Apple Far Out Event",
            "content": "Apple’s Far Out Event . On September 7th, 2022, Apple held a Far Out Event where they introduced the iPhone 14, Airpods Pro 2, and 3 new Apple Watches. . Apple iPhones . This year, I saw a model of what the iPhone 14’s would look like and I was not sure whether Apple would actually do that. The render showed the phone with not one, but two cutout notches, one in a circular shape, and next to it in another oval shape. I did not think Apple would do this, but they did with the Pro Models, and used this new hardware to improve their software with Dynamic Island, and instead of leaving screen between the two cutouts, they filled it with black to make it seem like one big oval cutout. . iPhone 14 . On this day, Apple announced 4 new iPhones, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max. This year they did not include an iPhone 14 mini, this is probably because they thought they didn’t need it anymore. However, one thing to note is that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus come with the Apple A15 Chip which is the same chip as the iPhone 13 and the iPhone 13 mini. However, the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro Max come with the newer A16 chip. . iPhone 14 Plus . Instead of the iPhone 14 mini, Apple decided to launch the iPhone 14 Plus which basically was the iPhone 14 but bigger and had a battery size for $100 more. I think they did this was because the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 mini were not selling as much as they had wanted, and for this new plus phone, I think the same will happen as well. . iPhone 14 Pro . I was surprised with this phone because of the new Dynamic Island . Apple Watches . Apple introduced three new apple watches. The Apple Watch SE (Starting at $299), Apple Watch Series 8 (Starting at $399), and the Apple Watch Ultra (Starting at $799). I was not really expecting the Apple Watch Ultra, but I was impressed with the look of it. All of these Apple Watches come with new Safety Detection Features just like with the new iPhones . Apple Watch SE . This Apple Watch is the budget apple watch for those people who don’t necessarily want to spend or need all of the other features. One big key thing Apple focused on during this event was Safety, especially with Crash Detection and Emergency SOS. Apple brought Crash Detection to this model and all the other apple watches announced here during this event . Apple Watch Series 8 . The Apple Watch Series 8 with a newer processor than last year and it has a temperature sensor. This watch also has crash detection so if it has detected you are in a crash it will notify first responders. It is also now capable of Bluetooth 5.3. This new watch comes with the S8 chip, but this does have the same CPU as the S7 Chip. It also comes with a newer and more powerful gyroscope and a high dynamic range accelerator, probably for the new safety features. Some thing this watch has now is a body temperature sensor, which was not on the Apple Watch Series 7. . Apple Watch Ultra . I was not expecting this watch at all, I was wondering what the purpose of this watch was, and it is for super dedicated athletes. I remember first seeing it at school during lunch and really liked the bands of the Series 8 Watch, but not so much the shape of the actual watch. Then I realized it was a whole new watch, and was made for professional athletes. . Airpods Pro 2 . During this event, Apple also announced a new generation of the Apple Airpods Pro’s which has the same look as the original ones, but the case now supports MagSafe Charging. Additionally, these new earbuds have improved noise cancellation and better sound quality. These improved earbuds now have richer bass. One big feature we have seen here is adaptive transparency mode which lets you hear some outside, but not all of them. .",

Using a While Loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Using a Recursive Loop . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

            "title": "Thoughts on the Alumni Panel",
            "content": "AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A Alumni Panel . On August 29th, 2022, 6 AP Computer Science Alumni that graduated Del Norte came from their colleges to talk to the students taking the class right now. . I attended the panel for 3 reasons; 1, I obviously wanted the extra credit; 2. I knew one of the panelists and wanted to see her thoughts; 3. I wanted to learn more about Computer Science and their experiences . The Beginning of the Panel . In the beginning of the panel was when everyone introduced themselves and what college they went to and what major they were doing. . When Colin said that he was a Mechanical Engineer at UCSD, I started listening closely to him because I wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer and I wanted to go to UCSD. 🤓🔧🎓 . Questions asked during the Panel . In the First Question, I learned that Computer Science is a very important skill and this really helps people in their daily lives. Nitya said that computer science really helps you to develop skills that are really important in other parts of your life. One example of this is that computer science can be frustrating and there can be so many errors that you have to learn to fix. Problem Solving is a huge skill that really helps in so many different areas. On top of this, when trying to solve problems you may go to others and find a solution together helping you to develop social skills which are also very useful. . Allison said that AP Computer Science Principles has really helped her with learning to develop websites which has gotten her many internships and helped her to get a lot of volunteering time. . Nitya also said that when she took the class during the pandemic, her and her group worked together to make a database about COVID-19 statistics and she realized that coding can be used to really help people around the world. This reminds me of a person I know who made websites for small businesses during the pandemic, and his web development skills are nice . Challenges faced during the class . When asked a question about challenges they had to overcome, a common answer was trying to understand all the programming content in the beginning weeks because they had to solve a lot of problems and had a lot of errors. Many of them felt that it was hard at the beginning even though some of them had prior experience, they still faced a lot of problems with their code. . Another Problem was that they were comparing themselves to others a lot and making themselves feel bad because they didn’t get an Internship at Google. Anthony even said that one of the not so great things you could do was look at other people’s linkedin profiles and seeing how many qualifications they have. . As mentioned before, coding can help in so many different areas and is an important skill to learn. I learned from the panelists that coding can really help in a high-level math class and Jupyter Notebooks helps in some classes as well. . Internships and Volunteering . In the beginning of the class, Mr. Mortensen mentioned that many students can get an internship from APCSP or APCSA and many have chosen that path. I know that Nitya did an internship with a professor at UCSD and now she studies at UCSD majoring in Computer Science. I also learned that many of the panelists did internships with their school. I also learned that the internships from major companies usually open up in September or in November, which really helps me because I want an internship. You can also even get an internship from an IT school which would be really helpful for experience. A popular company for internships seemed to be Northrup Grumman and they usually only take 20 students from PUSD. It is also really helpful to have a lot of linkedin friends or your friend’s parents for an internship at their work if you want to because referrals make it a lot easier to get an Internship. High School Internees can usually find one at a small company. . I also learned that Computer Science has helped with volunteer hours as I mentioned earlier as some people built websites for people such as Allison. She said that she volunteered at a church and helped build a website for them. . My Takeaways . ONE major takeaway I learned was that coding was a really important skill and is used all the time in different jobs and majors. Colin, who I was listening to because he was a mechanical engineer at UCSD, which is what I wanted to do, said that during his build projects he codes a script. This has made me want to practice coding way more because in the future if I can solve problems faster as a mechanical engineer than others, I have a higher chance of getting hired. . I was happy to hear that as a Mechanical Engineer at UCSD, Colin had to do a hands-on project as a freshman and in his senior year, he has to do another hands-on project. He said he used coding to help him speed up the build process .",

            "content": "Computer Science is focused a lot on Problem Solving and if you find interest in the class, it is such a really good experience . Computer Science is a really important skill and is very useful in your daily life even if you don’t want to major in Computer Science, the class teaches you skills in other majors such as Problem Solving . Allison said that web development was a really important skill that she learned that she uses very frequently and Computer Science Principles really helped her develop that skill . This class has helped many people such as Nitya to realize that Computer Science can be used in the real world. . A Big Challenge for Computer Scientists was starting and getting a lot of people saying how they were so good at Computer Science and this makes you feel like you need to compare yourself to them. . As a Mechanical Engineer at UCSD, you have to do a hands-on project freshman year and another hands-on project senior year, and you have to make the most of it. Computer Science was a class that helped the alumni to develop skills such as social skills and help them to understand how you learn the best. . The Mechanical Engineer at UCSD has used so much information from Computer Science for his major. Coding is everywhere and is really helpful for some projects and can help save a lot of time. Coding can help a lot in high-level math classes and Jupyter Notebooks are really helpful in some activities in College . Computer Science Principles and Computer Science A is really helpful to help you get internships at Colleges. I know Nitya got an internship at UCSD for Computer Science and this really helped her with her transition to UCSD. Code Ninjas is also a job with Computer Science that can help you a lot, Additionally, you can learn a lot from internships at IT schools. Allison helped a church group and did graphic design. Nitya did an internship at Northrup Grumman, but they only usually take 20 students from PUSD. . Colin who is a mechanical engineer at UCSD was able to use programming during his education at UCSD to help him solve problems. These problems would take too long without code, so coding has really helped him with building things. . This September and November are when most major companies start hiring for summer internships, and you need a resume, Smaller Companies usually take High School Student Internees. Ask some of your friends’ parents for an internship at a company. .",

            "content": "Last week in American Literature 1 . This past week, we had to write two poems in my class, one was finding words from a poem and making one from that, and then we had to make two new poems with our words. . The other poem was to write an actual poem using your own words . The First Poem about Immigration . An Immigrant Coincidence I came to America in hope for this promised life Once I arrived everything was out of sight Treated like an outstander with a lowlife I applied for a job but had to put up a fight . They directed me towards the department of agriculture With no friends, I sought a subculture Found myself surrounded by those with a similar incidence I don’t think this was a coincidence . I feel I have found my place Where everyone is alike with the same mission The relationship between us is like a baseball team trying to go to base Crowds of people all with a comforting smile, I finally feel recognition . Though this country may have a bell that rings liberty It reminds me of the taste of bitter tea So I say this country is only as good as it’s people . The Second Poem about Immigration . Shielded from the Warfare I thought this new world would be a place to call home But I have no freedom to roam At the park, I saw a bald eagle An American Symbol, yet making me feel illegal . I thought this country would be full of opportunities Hoping to make use of all the amenities Despite the uninviting feeling It does feel a little freewheeling . I thought this country would make me smaller Yet every day I feel more like a scholar The education here is like none other It feels great to not have to suffer . I thought this country wouldn’t care All of this to get away from warfare When I got here, all I could think of was being free The thought of getting a college degree . I thought this country would provide me with a shield And it has helped me become healed I am still discovering my capability Overjoyed with all the possibilities .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

Def: This defines a variable which is useful when using input and output in a program . Input: This is what the user inputs into the code . Output: Based on the user’s output the code will give something to the user . Procedural Abstraction: Grouping a sequence of commands and is used repeatedly . Protocol: Something that helps you to send and receive data . Unit 2 . Bits: The smallest unit of information in a computer, can either equal 0 or 1, and 8 bits are equal to one byte . Bytes: A basic unit of measurement for pieces of information; the space required to store one character . Hexadecimal/Nibbles: Pertaining to the base-16 number system represented by the digits 0 through 9 and the uppercase or lowercase letters A (equivalent to decimal 10) through F(equivalent to decimal 15) . Binary Numbers: A number expressed in binary form, or base, like 1100 which is 12 . Unsigned Integer: A data type that can only hold a whole number with a value greater than, or equal to, zero . Signed Integer: An integer that has a positive or negative sign . Floating Point: A number represented by an exponent according to a given base and to find the value of a floating-point number, the base is raised to the power of the exponent . Binary Data: A type of data that is represented or displayed in the binary numeral system . Abstractions: Extraction of relevant information from a larger data set, where utilizing abstraction allows engineers and others to simplify a codebase . Boolean: Pertaining to, or characteristic of logical (true, false) values . ASCII: Stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange and is a language that is just made up of symbols, its a standard single-byte character encoding scheme used for text-based data using designated 7-bit or 8-bit number combinations to represent either 128 or 256 possible characters. . Unicode: A character-encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world . RGB: The three colors used by a computer screen, all the other colors can be made up by mixing red, blue and green . Data Compression: A reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data . Lossy: If a process is lossy, it means that a little quality is lost when it is performed, meaning if a format is lossy, it means that putting data into that format will cause some slight loss . Lossless: Restores and rebuilds file data in its original form after the file is decompressed . Unit 3 . Variables: A named storage location capable of containing data that can be modified during a program’s run . Data Types: A classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations . Assignment Operators: The operator used to assign a new value to a variable, property, event or indexer element . Managing Complexity with Variables: This is for making sure that variables have a specific value so that the code can run . Lists: A table of records located in the main area for each computer in the user interface . 2D Lists: a two-dimensional data structure stored linearly in the memory, it has rows and columns . Dictionaries: A collection of keys or key and value pairs that is used for content or query processing in search .

Sequence: An ordered arrangement, as in a set of numbers, such as the Fibonacci sequence . Selection: A programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met . Iteration: Repeated runs of one or more statements or instructions. Statements or instructions so executed are said to be in a loop . Expressions: Any combination of operators, constants, literal values, functions, and names of fields (columns), controls, and properties that evaluates to a single value . Comparison Operators: Can compare numbers or strings and perform evaluations, like &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, &gt;, and === . Booleans Expressions and Selection: An expression that yields a Boolean value (true or false), such expressions can involve comparisons (testing values for equality or, for non—Boolean values, the &lt; [less than] or &gt; [greater than] relation) and logical combination (using Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and XOR) of Boolean expressions, a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met . Booleans Expressions and Iteration: An expression that yields a Boolean value (true or false), such expressions can involve comparisons (testing values for equality or, for non—Boolean values, the &lt; [less than] or &gt; [greater than] relation) and logical combination (using Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and XOR) of Boolean expressions, a process where the design of a product or application is improved by repeated review and testing . Truth Tables: A tabular representation of all the combinations of values for inputs and their corresponding outputs . Characters: A letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbols . Strings: A group of characters or character bytes handled as a single entity, computer programs use strings to store and transmit data and commands . Length: The amount of items in a list, and can be used as it’s own variable .

Upper: An element greater than or equal to all the elements in a given set . Lower: An element lesser than or equal to all the elements in a given set . Traversing Strings: It cuts off a substring from the original string and thus allows to iterate over it partially . Python If: A selection statement that allows more than one possible flow of control . Elif: This is short for else if and is used when the first if statement isn’t true, but you want to check for another condition . Else conditionals: A statement that runs a different set of statements depending on whether an expression is true or false . Nested Selection Statements: Used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a tas . Python For: A control flow statement that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied . While loops with Range: Uses a while function and used to create a sequence ranging between a certain limit . With List: An abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once . Combining loops with conditionals to Break: If a function is true or false, the break can be used in order to stop the function once a conditional has been reached . Continue: This statement passes control to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing do, for, or while statement in which it appears, bypassing any remaining statements in the do, for, or while statement body . Procedural Abstraction: The idea that each method should have a coherent conceptual description that separates its implementation from its users . Python Def procedures: A procedure allows us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name . Parameters: A value that is given to a variable, either at the beginning of an operation or before an expression is evaluated by a program . Return Values: A single value that is the result of the execution of a statement, method, or function . Iteration: Repetition of a Process . For Loop: FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated . While Loop: The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met . Initialization: What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0. . Condition: Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop. . Increment/Decrement: Modifies the counter variable after each repetition. . Indexing / List Index: The position of an element in a list, starting from 0 . Nesting: Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops. . Array: Another name for a list, depends on the language .",
