            "content": "Taking the Multiple Choice Test . I wanted to take the test over the weekend, but I did not get the time too. When I got to class on Monday, two of my groupmates had already finished it, so I decided to work with Jishnu. The questions were not too hard, but we spent a lot of time collaborating and explaining our answers to make sure the other one got it. We did this until Question 20, and I finished the rest by myself. I did this pretty quickly and finished quicker than expected and when I submitted I got a 43/50. . Test Corrections . After I submitted the test, I got a 43/50 (86%), which was around what I thought I would get. I was hoping to get an A, but I guess this means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills. . 1.D: 1/2 (50.0%) . 2.B: 5/7 (71.4%) . 3.A: 7/8 (87.5%) . 3.C: 3/4 (75.0%) . 4.A: 4/6 (66.7%) . I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don’t understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right. . Question 6 . Topic 1.3: Program Design and Development . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option D Incorrect. The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so only values less than or equal to max are printed. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option B Correct. The procedure initializes count to 1. Inside the loop, the value of count is displayed, then count is incremented by 2 to the next odd integer. The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so all positive odd integers less than or equal to max are printed. . . Reflection: This question was hard and I was not really sure how to interpret the code. I was not exactly sure of the value of the variable max and I did not really know how to solve it. I remember asking Jishnu about this problem, and I had no idea how to do it. . Question 11 . Topic 1.2: Program Function and Purpose . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option D Incorrect. The inner loop iterates from index j + 1 to the end of the list, so each element is compared with all the elements that follow it, not just the one element that immediately precedes it. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option B Correct. The algorithm traverses myList using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from the first element in the list to the second-to-last element in the list. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop compares that element to every subsequent element in the array. . . Reflection: This question was also very confusing as I did not know how to do it. I was not sure how to read the code, and I am not sure what it means by subsequent and preceding. I got the wrong answer, but it seemed close to the right answer so that was good. . Question 20 . Topic 2.1: Binary Numbers . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option B Incorrect. Four bits can represent 24, or 16 pieces of information, so it is not necessary to add extra bits. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option D Correct. Four bits can represent 24, or 16 pieces of information. . . Reflection: We did not really talk about Binary Numbers in class, so I had help from Jishnu because he knew a little bit about it. For this questions, I did not know what a bit was and how it was needed to store directions. . Question 21 . Topic 2.1: Binary Numbers . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option A Incorrect. Statement II is true because colors can be encoded as sequences of bits. Statement III is true because sequences of bits can be used to represent sound. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option D Correct. All digital data is represented at the lowest level as sequences of bits. Statement I is true because strings of characters can be represented by sequences of bits. Statement II is true because colors can be encoded as sequences of bits. Statement III is true because sequences of bits can be used to represent sound. . . Reflection: Just like the last question, we did not do Binary Numbers in class so I wasn’t sure about it. I did not know you can use binary to represent strings, colors, and audio, but I think that makes sense now. . Question 36 . Topic 3.10: Lists . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option D Incorrect. This would be the correct solution if i were initialized to 0 instead of 1. This code segment will generate the list [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option C Correct. For the first iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 2, is appended to evenList, and then i is incremented to 2. For the second iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 4, is appended to the list, and then i is incremented to 3. This continues eight more times, appending the next eight even numbers to evenList. This code segment will generate the list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]. . . Reflection: I was not sure how the order matters in this question, and I am still a little confused by it, but it makes a little more sense to me now because you should define the variable before running the code with the variable. . Question 37 . Topic 3.3: Mathematical Expressions . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option A Incorrect. A temporary variable is needed to interchange the values of two variables. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option D Correct. The first statement assigns the value of num1 to the temporary variable temp. The second statement assigns the value of num2 to num1. The third statement assigns the original value of num1, which is stored in temp, to num2. The original values of num1 to num2 are interchanged. . . Reflection: The question wanted to interchange the variables so I thought that switching them would be enough, but I didn’t realize that num1 is changed to num2, so when the second line of code is ran, num2 stays the same. . Question 39 . Topic 3.2: Data Abstraction . Explanation for Wrong Answer: Option C Incorrect. List indices are typically nonnegative integers, so a decimal number between two integers would be considered an invalid index. . Explanation for Correct Answer: Option D Correct. List indices are typically nonnegative integers. The exam reference sheet describes a list structure whose index values are 1 through the number of elements in the list, inclusive. So, 4 would be considered a valid index. . . Reflection: I was not sure how to answer this question at all, we did not do the videos for this CollegeBoard Big Idea, but we still went over it in class, and I was not sure what a valid index was, so I guessed on this question. . Confusing Problems . These are some problems that I was not sure how to do and I needed help to understand it. I did not really understand what the question was asking or how to answer it. I just chose what I thought was the best answer, and it was correct. . Question 2 . This question was really hard and I did not really know what to do. I do not know how I got this answer correct because I had no idea what it meant by procedure or mystery. I just followed the code on the inside and chose my answer, and it turned out to be right. . Question 9 . I still do not really understand this question, but I did understand that you need to change the lines for the code to work properly. When answering this question, I did not know what to do and Jishnu said to pick number 3 and explained it to me. . Question 44 . This question was a little hard mainly because I did not know what MOD was, so I had to look it up to find out it was the remainder which was not that hard. . Reflection on the Exam . Overall, the test was pretty easy and I think I could have received a higher score if I paid attention a little more. I think I went through this test pretty quickly when I did it by myself, but when I was talking with Jishnu, that took a lot of time because he was explaining some answers to me. I think I can do well on the AP Exam if I find out what exactly I need to do and keep reviewing the content. I got a 3/3. .",

            "content": "Background . Our Night at the Museum was on November 3rd, 2022, at 6:00pm-7:30pm. I had to take a 30 minute shift with the rest of my group and help explain our group project. We are in Period 4 with Mr. Mortensen so we had We had two laptops on display so that way we could present to more people easier. Our Project was a calendar and we used a frontend and a backend for it. Our backend was where we had to store our data for the calendar and then we had to show it on our frontend, and in order to get the data from the backend, we had to use fetch commands to get the data to show and save our calendar. I was a Frontend Developer so I worked a lot on the frontend and making it look nice. . Presenting our Flask Site . Backend We did not really present our backend site, the main purpose of the site was to have it run and use it as a place to store the data that the frontend had. In order to use the backend, we had to get off the School Wifi because it had the firewall which blocked AWS which was the host we used for the backend. We quickly went over this site if there were any people who wanted to know more about our project and how we did it. . Presenting our Fastpage Site . Frontend This was the site we used mainly for our users to interact with. If you go to the website you can use our project and see what exactly what the users do. You can also go on the website to try it out. We got a lot of people to try out our calendar, and my favorite people that came were these two parents who asked us a lot about our calendar really testing our knowledge. I had a lot of fun explaining our project to other people. . Looking at other Projects . After 6:30, we could go, but I brought my sister with me and she wanted to see the art and other projects. We first looked at other computer science projects and used them, but after that we went to other classes such as Ceramics, 3D Animation, and AP Studio Art. . Regarding AP Computer Science I looked at many projects even from Computer Science A. I liked to see how all the students in AP Computer Science A were working as well as their thought process. I took a picture of two people’s projects, Jonathan Wu (APCSP) and William Wu (APCSA). . Jonathan and his group’s project was about Jeopardy but on the night of the museum, they did not really have a frontend, so he just showed me the code, but they could not really get Jeopardy to work . William and his group’s project was really interesting and they had a lot of work done. They did a project about crimes with multiple pieces of information attached to it. I really liked their site and they had so many features and a lot of pages. I think they did a lot of work and really showed they knew what they were doing. I listened to them present it and I was very impressed because they had so much information. . After a couple of computer science projects, my sister wanted to go to the other classes, especially AP Studio Art. This was the class we spent the most time in after Computer Science. I even saw an old elementary school teacher that I talked to for a bit, so that was nice. My sister really seemed to enjoy this class and told me she wanted to take it. After this we looked a bit at Ceramics but mainly looked at 3D Computer Animation after that. I pulled up my work from 2 years ago, and I was amazed how different my project was compared to everyone’s that was displayed. Mine was just the basics and what was required, but so many people went above and beyond and I was amazed by this. .",

Input In [4] &lt;!-- HTML table fragment for page --&gt; ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax . This code is about HTML and it builds a table and you need the part in the beginning because it is put into a JavaScript Cell, but needs to be HTML in order to properly build the table and really show what exactly it needs to do in order to make the table. This really just sets up the code for the table so later the segments can format the data and help it ot understand what exactly is going on. . &lt; table &gt; makes a table, &lt; tr &gt; makes a row, &lt; th &gt; makes a column header, and &lt; thead &gt; is tag for the group header, and &lt; tbody &gt; is a tag used later to define an element id . &lt;!-- HTML table fragment for page --&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;All-time Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Recorded Deaths&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Active Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;time&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;total_cases&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;total_deaths&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td id=&quot;active_cases&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Country&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;All-time Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Recorded Deaths&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Active Cases&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody id=&quot;result&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- generated rows --&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; . This part of the code basically just preparing the code and the table before the code actually fetches the API and outputs it as well as formats it. It is basically just a sequence. I do not know exactly what each line of code does, but I thin this whole cell is just making the headers for the table so later segments of code can reference it and use it to make a table. . &lt;!-- Script is layed out in a sequence (no function) and will execute when page is loaded --&gt; &lt;script&gt; // prepare HTML result container for new output const resultContainer = document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;); // prepare fetch options const url = &quot;https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/covid/&quot;; const headers = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;default&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;omit&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39; // &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#39;, }, }; . I think this is the base code and the main part of the program that really shows what is going on and really explains what and how the API is being formatted. First it will fetch the API, and then it will organize it into headers. Before proceeding it checks for any errors and if there are no errors then it will probably run the top part with the if statement. After that it will take the data from the API and start the organization process. This also puts data and data.world_total in the console log. It also takes each specific part of the API and chooses how to format it. It grabs specific parts of the data and this helps the code to realize where specifically the code goes in the table and what exactly to do with it. Also for each time the code makes a row depending on the data, it sends the message row to the console. The last part kind of appends some child nodes so that way it follows a specific data system and puts the information of each cell along the rows. . // fetch the API fetch(url, headers) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors if (response.status !== 200) { const errorMsg = &#39;Database response error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = errorMsg; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); return; } // valid response will have json data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); console.log(data.world_total) // World Data document.getElementById(&quot;time&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.statistic_taken_at; document.getElementById(&quot;total_cases&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.total_cases; document.getElementById(&quot;total_deaths&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.total_deaths; document.getElementById(&quot;active_cases&quot;).innerHTML = data.world_total.active_cases; // Country data for (const row of data.countries_stat) { console.log(row); // tr for each row const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); // td for each column const name = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const cases = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const deaths = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const active = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); // data is specific to the API name.innerHTML = row.country_name; cases.innerHTML = row.cases; deaths.innerHTML = row.deaths; active.innerHTML = row.active_cases; // this builds td&#39;s into tr tr.appendChild(name); tr.appendChild(cases); tr.appendChild(deaths); tr.appendChild(active); // add HTML to container resultContainer.appendChild(tr); } }) }) . I think this code just tries to refetch the API if something does not work. I am not completely sure, but my best guess is that it just uses that and then creates elements based on what it has in the API. It will make a constant number of rows and cells to format the data into. . // catch fetch errors (ie ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { console.error(err); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = err; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); }); &lt;/script&gt;KeyboardEvent .",

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . .

We have hit a lot of standards from this video. Additionally, we have also done a lot of standards seen with all the activities we are doing, so that means we can actually learn a lot and are preparing a lot for the AP Exam. I can reference all the activities we did with the APCSP website, because each activity is posted with tags corresponding to which standards they relate to. . What standards are you looking forward to learning more about? . I am looking forward to learning more about web development and how it can be customized. I also want to learn more about how the Internet processes and sends data, even though we learned a little about it in Big Idea 4. I think it would be interesting to watch the rest of the videos for Big Idea 4. This would be really important because I can learn so much about it and if I finish all the CollegeBoard Videos by the AP Exam, I can just review my notes instead of having to watch the videos all over again. . What other careers can you benefit from being in this pathway? . I can benefit from so many other Careers in the STEM field. The STEM Field is a huge field with so many different job opportunities and wide variety of activities. I have heard from many people that taking this class helps build skills that many jobs use such as web development which can be used by software engineers or business owners. Also, another skill learned from this class can be collaboration which helps in so many different fields as this is an important skill to have for any job. .",

            "content": "Intro to Engineering at Qualcomm . On October 17, 2022, the WE STEM Club came to Del Norte and offered students in AP Computer Science Classes and other classes an opportunity to listen to the experiences of multiple Qualcomm Employees. These talks were split into two different parts and one talk was on Monday and the other on Tuesday. The talk on Monday was about Intro to Engineering at Qualcomm with Sumalatha Arugolana (Staff Engineer) and Nisha Sethia (Director of Engineering). On Tuesday, the second part of the talk was about Intersections of Business and STEM at Qualcomm with Sreeja Nair (Director of Product Management) and Lindsey Kostas (Staff Machine Learning Engineer). . Sumalatha Arugolana’s Talk . She was inspired by her mother and really gained interest in engineering | She was taught by her mother about math and science before school | She chose engineering because she was inspired by her mother and after college she was able to have a career in Engineering | After finding out what each stream of engineering did, she tried really hard and chose the one she liked the most | She is a Communications Engineer | Her College Experience | Qualcomm wants to bring new technologies to other fields such as automobiles | She works with mobile phones | Engineering is a Team Effort | She takes a lot of breaks from her work such as playing Tennis | She is not always in front of the laptop always and takes a lot of breaks from work | Did not take any college classes in America, only in India | . Nisha Sethia’s Talk . She was really inspired by her father and seeing all the things that he did | Girls were not taken that seriously for a STEM Major | She was very confused and did not know what major to do | She looked around and wanted to see why people chose the majors that they did and she reflected on herself asking what she wanted to do | When she graduated, the cellphone industry was not very big and she did not really know much about it | She was really curious about how the wireless phones worked and how they were able to function | After seeing, these phones she was really passionate about this field and really wanted to learn more about it so she started building 2G Phones | Felt the entire process was new to her | She gained a lot of interest in this field of mobile technologies and has not looked back | She made a goal to learn the system end to end | She joined Qualcomm in early 2010’s and helped to work on the 4G Phones | Today she works on the 5G Phones | To choose which field of engineering you want, keep a growth mindset and it may feel hard but try and get exposed to it and find which parts are your majors | Did not take any college classes in America, only in India | . Insights . After listening to this talk, I think it is very important to not compare yourself to others and that you should always stay curious. One of the questions was which field of engineering should I take, and this was a question that I find myself asking. Right now I want to become a Mechanical Engineering but there are so many options in Engineering. A way to find out which field of engineering is to find new experiences. Knowing there are a lot of fields I think I have narrowed it down to software engineering, hardware engineering, or mechanical engineering, but within those fields there are still a lot of different options. I have tried to expose myself a bit more especially by trying to do a lot of different STEM options like Robotics where I have tried doing Electrical and I am also doing AP Computer Science Principles and am quite interested in that as well. One of the speaker’s sons was challenging himself and majored in Mechanical Engineering. I now want to challenge myself more and participate in more STEM related classes and learn more about the process of Engineering. Getting more exposure to Engineering in High School is really important and it is important to learn all these concepts early on so classes will be easier in the future. . Takeaways . This talk has helped me a lot to realize what I need to do if I really want to go into the Engineering field. This talk has really shown me that I need to take all the challenges I have and the opportunities related to Engineering. I need to show more interest in STEM fields because I am really interested and I need to narrow down the STEM major I want to choose. I am in Robotics but I think I need to participate in Robotics more and make sure I am getting as much exposure as I can. I also think I should really use this Summer to my advantage and try to get more Experiences in the STEM field. .",

The Internet has been around for a while and there are many aspects to it like computing and the hardware. Computers used to be very big and people working that working with a big computer did not want to be alone so the internet was made. CSN - 1.A.1 defines a computing device as a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors. CSN - 1.A.3 says that a computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data. Also CSN - 1.A.7 says that the bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time. CSN - 1.B.1 says that the Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open nonproprietary communication protocols. CSN - 1.C.1 says that information is passed through the Internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets. . CollegeBoard Videos 4.1 Videos 1 and 2 .

CollegeBoard Quiz: The Internet Quiz . I took the CollegeBoard quiz about the Internet and out of the 3 questions, I got 2 of the questions right showing that I mostly understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make myself a better developer and understand what errors happened and how to fix them. I got the 3rd question wrong and this question was asking the difference between the World Wide Web and the Internet. I understand now and I was just a little confused on the definitions . Takeaways . Computers are used by people all the time, but computers were large so that means that they were not that portable so in order to communicate with others, the internet was made so computers could communicate with each other. Today, many people have access to the Internet, and in order to connect they need a computing device to send and receive data. This is usually the router which many people have that help them to connect to the internet. Data is sent over a network in packets which has data and tells routers where it is from and where it is going.

Errors in programming happen all the time but many people have a very hard time understanding what errors there are and how to solve them. Understanding the different errors is essential to becoming a proficient programmer. CRD - 2.I.1 says that a logic error is a mistake in the algorithm or program that causes it to behave incorrectly or unexpectedly. CRD 2.I.2 says that a syntax error is a mistake in the program where the rules of programming language are not followed. CRD - 2.I.5 says that test cases, hand tracing, visualizations, debuggers, and adding extra output statements are effective ways to find and correct errors. CRD - 2.J.2 is defined inputs used to test a program should demonstrate the different expected outcomes that are at or just beyond the extremes of input data. . CollegeBoard Videos 1.4 Videos 1, 2, and 3 . Video 1: . There are 4 types of errors, a logic error, a syntax error, a run-time error, and an overflow error | Programmers that are proficient should be able to notice all three types of errors | Logic Error: Caused by the programmer making a mistake in the algorithm which causes the program to behave unexpectedly | Syntax Error: A mistake when a programmer makes a typo or writes some code or forgets to write code, or maybe wrote code that doesn’t follow the program’s language rules and cause the program to fail | Run-Time Error: This causes the program to fail while running and is commonly known as a bug and to identify it, the program runs initially but fails and can’t complete its processes | Overflow Error: An overflow error is when a program is required to perform a calculation that is outside of defined range of values. Due to memory allocation constraints that programming languages require, certain values are too big to calculate or display. | . Video 2: . The easiest error to identify is usually the syntax error | Most IDE’s display information when there is no syntax error | The error usually shows where the error happened and tells people what to fix | Logic Errors are hard to find and correct which are not always noticed all the time and using test cases is the first strategy programmers use to find logic errors | A logic error is immediately noticed and using test cases is the first strategy programmers use to find logic errors | Hand tracing is another strategy and is useful with iteration or loops | Hand tracing can be useful for small code segments and loops that iterate a small number of times | Hand tracing can show that the algorithm was actually just displaying the last time a number was less than number after the list | Visualizations show graphs, images, color, and etc that can help determine if a program is working correctly | Debuggers use software designed to run a program allowing it to be paused and tested in the midst of running to determine if it is working properly | . Video 3: . Developers must start testing the program and need to think about it | The program specifications list the behaviors, events, and corresponding reponses/outputs the program is to support | Programmers need to define inputs that will determine whether or not the specifications are met | Once inputs and corresponding outputs are determined, programmers test, test, and test | After testing, programmers use the results the revise, refine, and improve their programs | Programmers have to test a program many times to make sure that everything is working | Programmers have to test and then the users have to test and then the programmers change even more | After a lot of testing, the program is finally released to other people | . CollegeBoard Quiz: Identifying and Correcting Errors Quiz . I took the CollegeBoard quiz about Identifying and Correcting Errors and out of the 3 questions, I got 3 of the questions right showing that I understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make myself a better developer and understand what errors happened and how to fix them. This quiz was a little hard especially on the first question because I did not really know how to do it, and I was between two answers, but now I understand it. . Takeaways . Developers face errors all the time and they need to make sure that they have to test a program a lot. There are many types of different errors like the logic error, syntax error, run-time error, and the overflow error. They have to test the program as much as they can and they test it and then get some users to test the program and find errors. When you get an error, there are many changes you can make, and the first step is to identify what the error is and how to solve it. The process of code is long and they need to make sure that everything is working. There are many ways to solve an error and one of them is hand tracing and you can use that to improve your code. .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. . In the Nighthawk Coders APCSP you can find an Overview and Examples using APIs:APCSP APIs menu- Using Covid RapidAPI JavaScript frontend API code in APCSP Fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-rapidapi.md | . | Making a Jokes API (this will next API tech talk) Frontend.

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. . RapidAPI- Google Developer I used an API from RapidAPI and this helped me and I used Currencies and it listed it Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). | .",

I did not know how to use the string | When I typed stop the code always broke | When I typed burger it did not work and ran the else statement | The break crashed the system | . | What are some test cases that can be used? inputting burger and getting the price of burger | adding items to the list and seeing if the total is right | Putting stop to see if the program outputs the right items | . | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. The code was always running the else part so I had to fix my indentation | Whenever I typed something on the menu, it would run the else statement, so I had to add elif to the functions above | . | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project?

There is a lot of development that has to go into programs to make the user interactions easier. CRD - 2.E.1 says that a development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. CRD 2.E.2 says that there are multiple development processes. the following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, and testing. CRD 2.F.3 also says that some ways investigation can be performed are with collecting data through surveys, user testing, interviews, and direct observations. CRD - 2.H.1 says that it is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source. CRD - 2.G.2 says that comments are a form of program documentation written into the program to be read by people, and do not how a program runs. . CollegeBoard Videos 1.3 Videos 1, 2, and 3 . Video 1: . A program is always developed with an idea | The idea always has a specific purpose in the mind and the people think about what they want to do and follow some steps | Developers are trying to stick to their plan and follow some specific steps | The Development can be very exploratory and the steps followed are based on what happens, people who are observing early AI Projects look for things to improve on and they try to make changes that might be useful | When making a program, developers have to determine the requirements of the program, understand the constraints like time, understand the user concerns and interests | Developers design the program by brainstorming, storyboarding, planning user experience, laying out the user interface, organizing into modules, and develop a testing strategy | Developers have to choose how a program should behave and include a list of user interactions | . Video 2: . Programs are developed by groups of people and groups use programming from other people and make it for themselves, but they must give credit | Different people or teams work on different components and they all work together as a team | When working in a team, credit must be given to people who were a part of the program, and documentation helps when fixing things and so that person gets credit | The program documentation should include the author’s name and the source of the code segments used | . Video 3: . Comments are used by Developers all the time to tell themselves what their code does and tell collaborators how their code works | In comments, they will describe the program, list program specifications, describe the program, and the list of contributors and authors | The developers will list the specifications of the program like the purpose | Developers keep track of the process while programming | After they are done, they should be able to explain the process | Comments can help the efficiency of programming, and help programmers to find bugs or understand what each piece of code says | To comment in Python, you need to put a # | To comment in Java, you need to put a //, /* Comments/, /** Documentation/ | To comment in HTML, you need to put &lt; !–Comment–&gt; | To comment in AppleScript, you need to (* Comment*) | To comment in Scratch or AppInventor, you can add comments to each block and can be shown when wanted | . CollegeBoard Quiz: Collaboration Quiz . I took the CollegeBoard quiz about Collaboration and out of the 3 questions, I got 3 of the questions right showing that I understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make collaborating with my group more efficient. I can use what I learned to make sure I am a better collaborator. I can add more comments to my code to help my group mates understand what I am trying to do. I can also add comments to my fastpage, so anyone looking at my code can see what I did. . Takeaways . There is a specific purpose for Developers when they are making a program and they have to do a lot of things. They also need to think about a lot and what they can add or change. They also need to do a lot of testing. Developers make a lot of additions based on feedback or they thought of improving something. Developers have to work in groups and they often work in small groups of large groups. They will all work on specific areas and then they will add comments to see what each program does. Documentation is very important for developers especially when they are in a team, so others can understand what is going on and credit can also be given to people. .",

For this project, I personally used W3Schools a little bit . W3Schools - reference | . console.log output . Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | I used Console.log in my AppLab | Whenever a button was clicked I would log it in the console | . console.log(&quot;Hello World!&quot;); . Hello World! . console.log(&quot;This is Edwin trying out the console.log command&quot;) . This is Edwin trying out the console.log command . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. During the CollegeBoard Daily Videos for Unit 1.2, I learned what a sequence of code was . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // This defines the variable &quot;msg&quot; and then prints it later with console.log console.log(msg); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function | . | . I noticed that you need to run previous codes because that is the only way the variable is defined. . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. . console.log(&quot;Reuse of logIT&quot;) logIt(&quot;Hello, Students!&quot;); logIt(2022) . Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely Typed Language . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. similar to Python and most interpretive languages. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2024); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List .

CRD - 2.A.2 is an understanding of the purpose of a computing innovations provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation. CRD - 2.C.1 says that program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. CRD - 2.D.1 says that program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. Also, CRD - 2.B.1 says that a program is a collection of program statements that perform s a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software. . CollegeBoard Videos 1.2 Videos 1, 2, and 3 . Video 1: . There are many computing innovations in the world that people use everyday | There are so many things that people use everyday | People use computing innovations all the time such as with online shopping and communication like email or smartphones | Social Media allows people to communicate with others online | E-Commerce is online shopping and helps you to save time and money because you can get products from your home | Digital Assistant Devices are helpful because they can do things automatically, and it can help save energy and time | .

Video 3: . A program is a collection of statements, which is a single command | A group of statements is called a code segment | A program is often referred to as software | Code Segments need to work for a variety of different lists, like lists that include numbers out of order, negative numbers, large numbers, or decimals | Descriptions of programs should have comments and should say what it does to help others and yourself, it can explain why in detail it works | .

I took the CollegeBoard quiz about Collaboration and out of the 6 questions, I got 4 of the questions right showing that I somewhat understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make collaborating with my group more efficient. I got question 4 and 6 wrong, but for question 4, I did not really look at one of the statements, so I think I should’ve have gotten that right, but for Question 6, I did not know how to read the code. . Takeaways . I have learned that are there are so many different functions when using a program and that can really help people in their daily lives. I also learned that there are many different types of input, and based on what your input is, the output can change, and events can happen based on actions. There are many different types of computing innovation in our lives, and I should try to innovate on any inventions to help people.

I really hope to learn as much as I can from this class so that in my future, I can continue developing these skills and use them for various actions. . One big thing that would be really helpful would be to update my Timebox each week so that way when it is time for the AP Exam, I can look at it and remember any important topics I need to study from that. . I also hope to do really well on the College Board Quizzes and try on them to see what I really need to go back and review.

Takeaways . I have learned that Collaboration is a huge part of many different jobs. It does not matter if you are working in a field that is not computer science, collaboration is important to everyone and helps connect things to make one big thing. For example, the way many apps look how they look is because of collaboration, one person can not really do all that so many people from different areas share ideas to make a product that users will enjoy. On the apple website, they need software engineers to program the cool transitions, but they also need artists to design the product so that the programmers can animate it. .",

            "title": "App Lab",
            "content": "Code.org AppLab . We were told to design an app using Code.org with an App Lab. I opened the App Lab and then went to the design tab and added a button to start the quiz. This picture below shows what the window looked like and by the end of this app, I hope it looks much better . My Plan for this AppLab is to make a Quiz about Technology with 4 Questions and I want them to be able to have multiple attempts to get the question right and that way they can for sure get a 100% on the quiz. . Final Draft . AppLab Part 1 - The Design of Homepage and Instruction . I also made a new screen for the rules and how to play page and I added code to make sure when the button was clicked it would switch to the rules and how to play the quiz. Here is a picture of what my homepage looks like . This is a picture of what my instruction page looks like and i used the same code as I did for the first button, I just changed it a little bit to make sure the code detected the right button. . The Designing and Coding of Question 1 . I started to make the questions and the first one would be about who the CEO of Google was and of course that is Sundar Pichai. I made it so that you had to click on the picture to respond. Here is a picture of what the first question looks like and whenever the user clicks on the wrong image, it will tell them that it is wrong and allow them to answer it again. . If the user clicked on the image of Jeff Bezos or anyone else it would send them to this screen . If the user clicked on the image of Sundar Pichai it would send them to this screen . My First Challenge . I have encountered one of my first issues and I have been told that I need to have a score at the end of my quiz, so I plan on just not allowing the users to redo the questions and just letting them have one chance and using variables at the end to tell the user the score. This does help me because this way, I do not have to make separate buttons for each time the user gets a question wrong to send them to next question, but I do have to make more screens, but I will make them look the same. . Designing and Coding of Question 2 . For question 2, I decided to ask a question about Samsung’s new folding smartphones and see if any users actually know about these phones and how Samsung has been able to make their displays foldable. The point of this question is to make users find out about these products and see if they are interested in it. This is what Question 2 looks like when done designing. . I also made the new screens if the user got the question wrong. . For the coding part of the quiz, I decided to use what I did for Question 2 and whenever a button is clicked, if that response is right it will tell them they got it right, but if the response is wrong, it will tell them they got it wrong. I decided to add a variable at the beginning called score. . The Coding Part was really simple, all I did were add 6 blocks and write what to do when the user clicked one of the buttons, here is what the code looked like. . I do want to add the variables for my score but I want to do that later at the end, right now I want to make sure my code actually works. . Designing and Coding of Question 3 . For question 3, I am going to ask a question about electric cars and see if the user knows which one of the cars has the fastest 0-60 mph, and you can actually buy right now today. . After Designing question 3, this is what the questions looks like, there are 4 options, a Tesla Model S Plaid, a Lucid Air Dream Edition, a Rivian R1S, and a Ford Mustang Mach-E. The correct answer will be the Tesla Model S Plaid. . The code is the same for the other two questions and just tells it what to do after a button has been clicked. . Designing and Coding of Question 4 . I did what I made for the previous questions but this time I wanted to focus on Audio and let users see all the different headphone designs by different companies to see what interested them. After finishing designing this Question, this is what it looked like. . Designing and Coding the End with Score . For this part, I decided to design the page by thanking the users for taking my quiz. Also I decided to take the total score of the quiz the user took and let them know what their score was at the end of the quiz. I did this by adding variables and making sure that in the text box at the end the variable score would be shown. . In order to tell the user their score I had to use the variable I had at the end, so I added code to add a point each time the user got a question right, and if they got it wrong the variable would stay the same. Here is a picture of the code that I added for each question. . This tells the user what their score will be at the end of the quiz out of 4. . My Second Challenge . I finished putting all the variable blocks for each one and I tested it, I got one question wrong but at the end of the quiz, this is that image I saw. . In the image, the text box is blank and that means the user does not know their score so I had to try and fix that. In order to fix this, I looked at someone else’s code and found out that I was using the wrong block of code. After looking at someone else’s code, I realized that I was using the wrong block and found out that I was actually defining the variable each time instead of setting the variable to a number. . I found out the right block of code and that basically allowed the variable to be set to the actual score and that variable was kept throughout the whole quiz. This way when I set the text to the actual variable, the key value would show what the user’s score on the quiz was. .",

Using a While Loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() .

Using a Recursive Loop . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

            "title": "Thoughts on the Alumni Panel",
            "content": "AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science A Alumni Panel . On August 29th, 2022, 6 AP Computer Science Alumni that graduated Del Norte came from their colleges to talk to the students taking the class right now. . I attended the panel for 3 reasons; 1, I obviously wanted the extra credit; 2. I knew one of the panelists and wanted to see her thoughts; 3. I wanted to learn more about Computer Science and their experiences . The Beginning of the Panel . In the beginning of the panel was when everyone introduced themselves and what college they went to and what major they were doing. . When Colin said that he was a Mechanical Engineer at UCSD, I started listening closely to him because I wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer and I wanted to go to UCSD. 🤓🔧🎓 . Questions asked during the Panel . In the First Question, I learned that Computer Science is a very important skill and this really helps people in their daily lives. Nitya said that computer science really helps you to develop skills that are really important in other parts of your life. One example of this is that computer science can be frustrating and there can be so many errors that you have to learn to fix. Problem Solving is a huge skill that really helps in so many different areas. On top of this, when trying to solve problems you may go to others and find a solution together helping you to develop social skills which are also very useful. . Allison said that AP Computer Science Principles has really helped her with learning to develop websites which has gotten her many internships and helped her to get a lot of volunteering time. . Nitya also said that when she took the class during the pandemic, her and her group worked together to make a database about COVID-19 statistics and she realized that coding can be used to really help people around the world. This reminds me of a person I know who made websites for small businesses during the pandemic, and his web development skills are nice . Challenges faced during the class . When asked a question about challenges they had to overcome, a common answer was trying to understand all the programming content in the beginning weeks because they had to solve a lot of problems and had a lot of errors. Many of them felt that it was hard at the beginning even though some of them had prior experience, they still faced a lot of problems with their code. . Another Problem was that they were comparing themselves to others a lot and making themselves feel bad because they didn’t get an Internship at Google. Anthony even said that one of the not so great things you could do was look at other people’s linkedin profiles and seeing how many qualifications they have. . As mentioned before, coding can help in so many different areas and is an important skill to learn. I learned from the panelists that coding can really help in a high-level math class and Jupyter Notebooks helps in some classes as well. . Internships and Volunteering . In the beginning of the class, Mr. Mortensen mentioned that many students can get an internship from APCSP or APCSA and many have chosen that path. I know that Nitya did an internship with a professor at UCSD and now she studies at UCSD majoring in Computer Science. I also learned that many of the panelists did internships with their school. I also learned that the internships from major companies usually open up in September or in November, which really helps me because I want an internship. You can also even get an internship from an IT school which would be really helpful for experience. A popular company for internships seemed to be Northrup Grumman and they usually only take 20 students from PUSD. It is also really helpful to have a lot of linkedin friends or your friend’s parents for an internship at their work if you want to because referrals make it a lot easier to get an Internship. High School Internees can usually find one at a small company. . I also learned that Computer Science has helped with volunteer hours as I mentioned earlier as some people built websites for people such as Allison. She said that she volunteered at a church and helped build a website for them. . My Takeaways . ONE major takeaway I learned was that coding was a really important skill and is used all the time in different jobs and majors. Colin, who I was listening to because he was a mechanical engineer at UCSD, which is what I wanted to do, said that during his build projects he codes a script. This has made me want to practice coding way more because in the future if I can solve problems faster as a mechanical engineer than others, I have a higher chance of getting hired. . I was happy to hear that as a Mechanical Engineer at UCSD, Colin had to do a hands-on project as a freshman and in his senior year, he has to do another hands-on project. He said he used coding to help him speed up the build process .",

Computer Science is a really important skill and is very useful in your daily life even if you don’t want to major in Computer Science, the class teaches you skills in other majors such as Problem Solving . Allison said that web development was a really important skill that she learned that she uses very frequently and Computer Science Principles really helped her develop that skill . This class has helped many people such as Nitya to realize that Computer Science can be used in the real world. . A Big Challenge for Computer Scientists was starting and getting a lot of people saying how they were so good at Computer Science and this makes you feel like you need to compare yourself to them. . As a Mechanical Engineer at UCSD, you have to do a hands-on project freshman year and another hands-on project senior year, and you have to make the most of it. Computer Science was a class that helped the alumni to develop skills such as social skills and help them to understand how you learn the best. . The Mechanical Engineer at UCSD has used so much information from Computer Science for his major. Coding is everywhere and is really helpful for some projects and can help save a lot of time. Coding can help a lot in high-level math classes and Jupyter Notebooks are really helpful in some activities in College . Computer Science Principles and Computer Science A is really helpful to help you get internships at Colleges. I know Nitya got an internship at UCSD for Computer Science and this really helped her with her transition to UCSD. Code Ninjas is also a job with Computer Science that can help you a lot, Additionally, you can learn a lot from internships at IT schools. Allison helped a church group and did graphic design. Nitya did an internship at Northrup Grumman, but they only usually take 20 students from PUSD. . Colin who is a mechanical engineer at UCSD was able to use programming during his education at UCSD to help him solve problems. These problems would take too long without code, so coding has really helped him with building things. . This September and November are when most major companies start hiring for summer internships, and you need a resume, Smaller Companies usually take High School Student Internees. Ask some of your friends’ parents for an internship at a company. .",

            "content": "Last week in American Literature 1 . This past week, we had to write two poems in my class, one was finding words from a poem and making one from that, and then we had to make two new poems with our words. . The other poem was to write an actual poem using your own words . The First Poem about Immigration . An Immigrant Coincidence I came to America in hope for this promised life Once I arrived everything was out of sight Treated like an outstander with a lowlife I applied for a job but had to put up a fight . They directed me towards the department of agriculture With no friends, I sought a subculture Found myself surrounded by those with a similar incidence I don’t think this was a coincidence . I feel I have found my place Where everyone is alike with the same mission The relationship between us is like a baseball team trying to go to base Crowds of people all with a comforting smile, I finally feel recognition . Though this country may have a bell that rings liberty It reminds me of the taste of bitter tea So I say this country is only as good as it’s people . The Second Poem about Immigration . Shielded from the Warfare I thought this new world would be a place to call home But I have no freedom to roam At the park, I saw a bald eagle An American Symbol, yet making me feel illegal . I thought this country would be full of opportunities Hoping to make use of all the amenities Despite the uninviting feeling It does feel a little freewheeling . I thought this country would make me smaller Yet every day I feel more like a scholar The education here is like none other It feels great to not have to suffer . I thought this country wouldn’t care All of this to get away from warfare When I got here, all I could think of was being free The thought of getting a college degree . I thought this country would provide me with a shield And it has helped me become healed I am still discovering my capability Overjoyed with all the possibilities .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
