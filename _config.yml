title: Edwin's Blog
description: A blog made by Edwin, to test out programming and learn how to make more websites
github_username: EdwinKuttappi
# you can comment the below line out if your repo name is not different than your baseurl
github_repo: "fastpage1"

# OPTIONAL: override baseurl and url if using a custom domain
# Note: leave out the trailing / from this value. 
url: "https://EdwinKuttappi.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com

###########################################################
#########  Special Instructions for baseurl ###############
#
#### Scenario One: If you do not have a Custom Domain #####
#    -  if you are not using a custom domain, the baseurl *must* be set to your repo name
# 
####  Scenario Two: If you have a Custom Domain #####
# 1. If your domain does NOT have a subpath, this leave this value as ""
# 2. If your domain does have a subpath, you must preceed the value with a / and NOT have a / at the end.  
#      For example: 
#           "" is valid
#           "/blog"        is valid
#            "/blog/site/" is invalid  ( / at the end)
#            "/blog/site"  is valid
#            "blog/site"   is invalid  ( because doesn't begin with a /)
#
# 3. You must replace the parameter `baseurl` in _action_files/settings.ini with the same value as you set here but WITHOUT QUOTES.
#
baseurl: "/fastpage1" # the subpath of your site, e.g. "/blog".

# Github and twitter are optional:

weekly_summaries: [
  This week was the hardest week where we set up tools such as VSCode and Anaconda.
  In this week we were supposed to make our first markdown post and make a jupyter notebook.,
  We learned more about Python and how to install it and was able to make a quiz. 
  We took a code from Mr. Mortensen and had to program a quiz that showed we knew CollegeBoard Terms.,
  This week was the week that he had to write lists and dictionaries and use them in our codes. 
  We had to take a database on information from us and our partners and made a list of them to output.
  We were also introduced into changing the design of the websites such as making the background darker or a different color and styling with HTML.,
  During this week we had to make an app like a quiz using the AppLab in code.org. This week also helped us prepare for the Creative Development portion of the AP Exam.
  There are 6 rows and each one is worth 1 point making the total on the AP Exam for this portion 6 points.
