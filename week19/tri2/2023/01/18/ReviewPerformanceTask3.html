<h1 id="takeaways">
<a class="anchor" href="#takeaways" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Takeaways</h1>
<p>Similar to the past few performance task scoring assignments, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. I’ve gotten used to the CollegeBoard Rubric and I think I know how to get a program that fulfills all of these programs. Knowing that actual people are grading our AP Exams, it can be determined that there can be different opinions. For example, on the first one, some people may think it deserves a 2, while some other people think it deserves a 4. This assignment just shows that the score one person thinks you got might not be your actual score, so it is important to review the rubric and try to get every single point.</p>
