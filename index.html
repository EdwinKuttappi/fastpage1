'This site is built by [Edwin](https://github.com/EdwinKuttappi), a relatively new programmer who is using Jupyter for the first time.'

#Goals

On this blog, you will see many different projects done by me for my Computer Science Principles Class. I am trying to learn how to program and get ready for this year.
This blog will have a lot of projects, and in this current state, it does not look super professional, but with some time, I hope to improve this website
