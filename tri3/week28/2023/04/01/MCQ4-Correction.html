<a class="anchor" href="#taking-the-multiple-choice-test" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Taking the Multiple Choice Test</h1>
<p>We were assigned a 50 Question Multiple Choice Test in preparation for the AP Exam and we know what to expect on that day. This was assigned on a Friday, but we had until the next Monday to finish it. Many of my groupmates had started it and I worked with some of them to get maybe the first 15 questions done, but I had to I did this pretty quickly and finished quicker than expected and when I submitted I got a 46/50 (92.0%).</p>

<h1 id="test-corrections">
<a class="anchor" href="#test-corrections" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Test Corrections</h1>
<p>After I submitted the test, I got a 43/50 (86%), and I was surprised that I only got seven problems wrong, most of the questions were easy but I did not know how to answer them some of them. I did get an B, but I should also work on improving those other concepts. This means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills.</p>

<p><img src="/fastpage1/images/tri2final.png" alt=""></p>

<p>1.A: 1/3 (33.3%)</p>

<p>1.D: 8/10 (80.0%)</p>

<p>2.A: 1/1 (100.0%)</p>

<p>2.B: 7/8 (87.5%)</p>

<p>3.B: 2/2 (100.0%)</p>

<p>3.C: 5/5 (100.0%)</p>

<p>4.B: 2/2 (100.0%)</p>

<p>5.A: 5/6 (83.3%)</p>

<p>5.B: 9/10 (90.0%)</p>

<p>5.D: 3/3 (100.0%)</p>

<p>I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don’t understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right.</p>

<h2 id="question-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 1</h2>
<p><strong>Topic 4.3</strong>: Parallel and Distributed Computing</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Wrong Answer: B, this option is incorrect. Statement III is also correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Correct Answer: C, this option is correct. Statement I is correct because the Creative Commons license is designed to increase the amount of content available to the public for free. Statement III is correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users.</p>

<h2 id="question-9">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-9" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 9</h2>
<p><strong>Topic 4.1</strong>: The Internet</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Wrong Answer: B, The user’s browser makes a request for the file, and the file is broken into packets by the server for transmission. The user’s browser does not request each packet in order.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Correct Answer: A, Digital data on the Internet is sent by breaking data into blocks of bits called packets. The packets are reassembled by the user’s computer.</p>

<h2 id="question-23">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-23" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 23</h2>
<p><strong>Topic 2.3</strong>: Extracting Information from Data</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Wrong Answer: D, Suggestions for other products to purchase based on viewed items is a useful pattern for an online retailer to find. A collection of all the products their customers are viewing is a large data set.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Correct Answer: C, By current standards, a single high school’s list of student grades is not considered a large set of data. Furthermore, identifying 10 students with the highest grade point averages is not an example of finding patterns.</p>

<h2 id="question-27">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-27" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 27</h2>
<p><strong>Topic 2.2</strong>: Data Compression</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Wrong Answer: D,  By copying pixels from one part of the image to another part of the image, the old RGB values of the pixels have been lost.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Correct Answer: C, If a negative of the original image is made, each RGB triplet value will be computed by subtracting the original value from 255. The original value can then be restored by subtracting the new value from 255. This process is lossless because the exact original can be restored.</p>

<h2 id="question-34">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-34" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 34</h2>
<p><strong>Topic 3.18</strong>: Undecidable Problems</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Wrong Answer: A, This statement does not provide enough information to conclude that the problem is undecidable. If it could be shown that an algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer for all other instances of this problem, then this problem would be decidable.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Correct Answer: B, A decidable problem is one for which an algorithm can be constructed to produce a correct output for all inputs. If, for one instance of the problem, this is not possible, then this problem cannot be decidable. Therefore, it must be undecidable.</p>

<h2 id="question-38">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-38" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 38</h2>
<p><strong>Topic 3.16</strong>: Simulations</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Wrong Answer: A, Simulations facilitate the formation and refinement of hypotheses. By varying the input data to the simulation, the operation of the train can be tested under a variety of circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Correct Answer: D, Simulations are most useful when real-world events are impractical for experiments. Discovering and correcting potential safety issues using a simulation before the train route is constructed is much safer and less expensive than discovering them after the train route has been constructed.</p>

<h2 id="question-42">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-42" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 42</h2>
<p><strong>Topic 3.14</strong>: Libraries</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Wrong Answer: C, Determining whether two text files have the same exact content is not useful when attempting to determine whether a word appears in two text files.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> for Correct Answer: B, correct. Two calls to this procedure can be used to determine if a particular word appears in each of two text files. If both calls return true, then the word appears in both text files.</p>

<h2 id="question-2">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 2</h2>
<p><img src="/fastpage1/images/midtermquestion2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I did not understand the purpose of the program and I had to try and guess what could be changed in order to find out the answer. On this question, I had to guess the answer because I did not know what would make sure the output of the code would stay the same.</p>

<h2 id="question-16">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-16" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 16</h2>
<p><img src="/fastpage1/images/midtermquestion16.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This question was a complete guess because I had no idea what each one meant completely, I had an idea of each one, but I wasn’t sure why the answer was selection, I knew it couldn’t be iteration because that would help with the even number, and I had to guess between the other three choices, and I was right. I still do not understand but maybe I can understand by looking at someone else’s test corrections.</p>

<h2 id="question-30">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-30" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 30</h2>
<p><img src="/fastpage1/images/midtermquestion30.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This question was very hard and I did not reallt understand what the question was asking and I had no idea what I had to do. I got this question right but I did not know why it was B and C, all I knew was that it was not A or D because the circles did not line up.</p>

<h1 id="reflection-on-the-exam">
<a class="anchor" href="#reflection-on-the-exam" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reflection on the Exam</h1>
<p>Overall, the test was pretty easy and I am happy with ny score, but I should try to get a higher score. If I paid attention a little more, I think I could have understood the questions a bit more I think I went through this test pretty slowly because I did not really understand each question and I had to read it a lot of times. I think I can do well on the AP Exam if I find out what exactly I need to do and keep reviewing the content, spend less time on each problem.</p>
