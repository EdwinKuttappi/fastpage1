# Vocabulary from CollegeBoard to help study
**Sequence**: Two or more lines forms a sequence

**Def**: This defines a variable which is useful when using input and output in a program

**Input**: This is what the user inputs into the code

**Output**: Based on the user's output the code will give something to the user

**Procedural Abstraction**: Grouping a sequence of commands and is used repeatedly

**Protocol**: Something that helps you to send and receive data

# Unit 2
**Bits**: The smallest unit of information in a computer, can either equal 0 or 1, and 8 bits are equal to one byte

**Bytes**:  A basic unit of measurement for pieces of information; the space required to store one character

**Hexadecimal/Nibbles**: Pertaining to the base-16 number system represented by the digits 0 through 9 and the uppercase or lowercase letters A (equivalent to decimal 10) through F(equivalent to decimal 15)

**Binary Numbers**: A number expressed in binary form, or base, like 1100 which is 12

**Unsigned Integer**: A data type that can only hold a whole number with a value greater than, or equal to, zero

**Signed Integer**: An integer that has a positive or negative sign

**Floating Point**: A number represented by an exponent according to a given base and to find the value of a floating-point number, the base is raised to the power of the exponent

**Binary Data**: A type of data that is represented or displayed in the binary numeral system

**Abstractions**: Extraction of relevant information from a larger data set, where utilizing abstraction allows engineers and others to simplify a codebase

**Boolean**: Pertaining to, or characteristic of logical (true, false) values

**ASCII**: Stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange and is a language that is just made up of symbols, its a standard single-byte character encoding scheme used for text-based data using designated 7-bit or 8-bit number combinations to represent either 128 or 256 possible characters.

**Unicode**: A character-encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world

**RGB**: The three colors used by a computer screen, all the other colors can be made up by mixing red, blue and green

**Data Compression**: A reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data

**Lossy**: If a process is lossy, it means that a little quality is lost when it is performed, meaning if a format is lossy, it means that putting data into that format will cause some slight loss

**Lossless**: Restores and rebuilds file data in its original form after the file is decompressed

# Unit 3
**Variables**: A named storage location capable of containing data that can be modified during a program's run

**Data Types**: A classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations

**Assignment Operators**: The operator used to assign a new value to a variable, property, event or indexer element

**Managing Complexity with Variables**: This is for making sure that variables have a specific value so that the code can run

**Lists**: A table of records located in the main area for each computer in the user interface

**2D Lists**: a two-dimensional data structure stored linearly in the memory, it has rows and columns

**Dictionaries**: A collection of keys or key and value pairs that is used for content or query processing in search

**Class**: A set of objects that share a common definitional property, that share common operations and behavior, or both

**Algorithms**: A rule or procedure for solving a problem

**Sequence**: An ordered arrangement, as in a set of numbers, such as the Fibonacci sequence

**Selection**: A programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met

**Iteration**: Repeated runs of one or more statements or instructions. Statements or instructions so executed are said to be in a loop

**Expressions**: Any combination of operators, constants, literal values, functions, and names of fields (columns), controls, and properties that evaluates to a single value

**Comparison Operators**: Can compare numbers or strings and perform evaluations, like <, <=, >=, >, and ===

**Booleans Expressions and Selection**: An expression that yields a Boolean value (true or false), such expressions can involve comparisons (testing values for equality or, for non—Boolean values, the < [less than] or > [greater than] relation) and logical combination (using Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and XOR) of Boolean expressions, a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met

**Booleans Expressions and Iteration**: An expression that yields a Boolean value (true or false), such expressions can involve comparisons (testing values for equality or, for non—Boolean values, the < [less than] or > [greater than] relation) and logical combination (using Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and XOR) of Boolean expressions, a process where the design of a product or application is improved by repeated review and testing

**Truth Tables**: A tabular representation of all the combinations of values for inputs and their corresponding outputs

**Characters**: A letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbols

**Strings**: A group of characters or character bytes handled as a single entity, computer programs use strings to store and transmit data and commands

**Length**: The amount of items in a list, and can be used as it's own variable

**Concatenation**: The process of combining two or more character strings or expressions into a single character string or expression, or combining two or more binary strings or expressions into a single binary string or expression

**Upper**: An element greater than or equal to all the elements in a given set

**Lower**: An element lesser than or equal to all the elements in a given set

**Traversing Strings**: It cuts off a substring from the original string and thus allows to iterate over it partially

**Python If**: A selection statement that allows more than one possible flow of control

**Elif**: This is short for else if and is used when the first if statement isn't true, but you want to check for another condition

**Else conditionals**: A statement that runs a different set of statements depending on whether an expression is true or false

**Nested Selection Statements**: Used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a tas

**Python For**: A control flow statement that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied

**While loops with Range**: Uses a while function and used to create a sequence ranging between a certain limit

**With List**: An abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once

**Combining loops with conditionals to Break**: If a function is true or false, the break can be used in order to stop the function once a conditional has been reached

**Continue**: This statement passes control to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing do, for, or while statement in which it appears, bypassing any remaining statements in the do, for, or while statement body

**Procedural Abstraction**: The idea that each method should have a coherent conceptual description that separates its implementation from its users

**Python Def procedures**: A procedure allows us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name

**Parameters**: A value that is given to a variable, either at the
beginning of an operation or before an expression is evaluated by a program

**Return Values**: A single value that is the result of the execution of a statement, method, or function

**Iteration**: Repetition of a Process

**For Loop**: FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated

**While Loop**: The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met

**Initialization**: What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0.

**Condition**: Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop.

**Increment/Decrement**: Modifies the counter variable after each repetition.

**Indexing / List Index**: The position of an element in a list, starting from 0

**Nesting**: Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops.

**Array**: Another name for a list, depends on the language
