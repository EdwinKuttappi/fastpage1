**Output**: Based on the user's output the code will give something to the user

**Procedural Abstraction**: Grouping a sequence of commands and is used repeatedly

**Protocol**: Something that helps you to send and receive data

# Unit 2
**Bits**: The smallest unit of information in a computer, can either equal 0 or 1, and 8 bits are equal to one byte

**Bytes**:  A basic unit of measurement for pieces of information; the space required to store one character

**Hexadecimal/Nibbles**: Pertaining to the base-16 number system represented by the digits 0 through 9 and the uppercase or lowercase letters A (equivalent to decimal 10) through F(equivalent to decimal 15)

**Binary Numbers**: A number expressed in binary form, or base, like 1100 which is 12

**Unsigned Integer**: A data type that can only hold a whole number with a value greater than, or equal to, zero

**Signed Integer**: An integer that has a positive or negative sign

**Floating Point**: A number represented by an exponent according to a given base and to find the value of a floating-point number, the base is raised to the power of the exponent

**Binary Data**: A type of data that is represented or displayed in the binary numeral system

**Abstractions**: Extraction of relevant information from a larger data set, where utilizing abstraction allows engineers and others to simplify a codebase

**Boolean**: Pertaining to, or characteristic of logical (true, false) values

**ASCII**: Stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange and is a language that is just made up of symbols, its a standard single-byte character encoding scheme used for text-based data using designated 7-bit or 8-bit number combinations to represent either 128 or 256 possible characters.

**Unicode**: A character-encoding standard developed by the Unicode Consortium that represents almost all of the written languages of the world

**RGB**: The three colors used by a computer screen, all the other colors can be made up by mixing red, blue and green

**Data Compression**: A reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data

**Lossy**: If a process is lossy, it means that a little quality is lost when it is performed, meaning if a format is lossy, it means that putting data into that format will cause some slight loss

**Lossless**: Restores and rebuilds file data in its original form after the file is decompressed

**Python Def procedures**:

**Parameters**: 

**Return Values**:

**Iteration** - Repetition of a Process

**For Loop** - FOR LOOP repeats a function for a set number of times; I is the number of times repeated

**While Loop** - The while loop is used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met

**Initialization** - What sets the counter variable to a starting value. For example (var i = 0) represents an initial value of 0.

**Condition** - Allows the computer to know whether or not to keep repeating the loop.

**Increment/Decrement** - Modifies the counter variable after each repetition.

**Indexing / List Index** - The position of an element in a list, starting from 0

**Nesting** - Having one data type or function inside another data type or function, such as lists or loops.

**Array** - Another name for a list, depends on the language
