# About Edwin

Hi, my name is Edwin and I am currently a Junior at Del Norte High School and do have some experience in coding but nothing like this. I am very excited to do more projects like this, because it is a little fun

## Github Link

The programmer of this site is **[Edwin](https://github.com/EdwinKuttappi)** [^1] and he is somewhat new and trying really hard to code. He likes to play video games and participate in outdoor activities such as hiking.

## Hobbies and Favorites

I have many hobbies such as playing video games, going outside with my friends, hiking, biking, and play some sports for fun such as badminton. I really like STEM and want a career in it in the future. I love to learn about the latest technology especially in automation and mobile phones.

My Favorite Food is Pizza and my Favorite Dessert are Brownies.

As mentioned earlier, I love to learn about the latest technology, including learning about the latest software updates on phones and seeing the features added. Did you know that Apple has allowed you to use your smartphone's cameras as your macbook's webcam, and it can even crop into your desk view!
