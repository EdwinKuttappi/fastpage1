CRD - 2.E.1 says that a development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. CRD 2.E.2 says that there are multiple development processes. the following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, and testing. CRD 2.F.3 also says that some ways investigation can be performed are with collecting data through surveys, user testing, interviews, and direct observations.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/fastpage1/images/collegeboardvideo3.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/fastpage1/images/collegeboardvideo3.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Customizing my Python Flask</title><link href="https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/fastpage1/week5/tri1/2022/09/25/PythonFlaskChanges.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Customizing my Python Flask" /><published>2022-09-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/fastpage1/week5/tri1/2022/09/25/PythonFlaskChanges</id><author><name>Edwin Abraham</name></author><category term="week5" /><category term="tri1" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changing and Customizing my own Python Flask Home Page I went to the index.html file and I was able to learn what each code was doing and I saw that you could code a card and I decided to add another code under the heading About Me.

CRD - 2.A.1 says that the purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression. CRD - 2.A.2 is an understanding of the purpose of a computing innovations provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation. CRD - 2.C.1 says that program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. CRD - 2.D.1 says that program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. Also, CRD - 2.B.1 says that a program is a collection of program statements that perform s a specific task when run by a computer.
