| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Program Purpose and Function** | 1 | 1 | They showed how the program worked and how it was able to use the input and output, as well as describe the functionality and purpose of the program |
| **Data Abstraction** | 0 | 0 | There are two code segments and it shows a list of RPS, but in the second segment, it doesn't really use that list, but I am not sure if the lisst is necessary |
| **Managing Complexity** | 0 | 0 | This person did not show how the data has been managed showing how the data in the list is used as an output |
| **Procedural Abstraction** | 1 | 0 | There is one procedure that shows all the code and then later in one line of code, that line of code is calling the function, and talks about how it contributes to the function of the program |
| **Algorithm Implementation** | 0 | 1 | This person was using an algorithm that showed some iteration and selection, but I am not really sure that there was sequencing, and ther was not too much detail |
| **Testing** | 1 | 1 | This person ran two different calls and they both include the conditions that were tested by that, and then after that it will find the output, and this person talked about the different results of each call |

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Program Purpose and Function** | 1 | 1 | This person did describe the program's purpose and the functionality of it as well, and also showed the input and output of the program working |
| **Data Abstraction** | 1 | 1 | This person shows a list of nouns in the first picture, and in the second picture, they also show how that list is used in the form of a parameter |
| **Managing Complexity** | 1 | 1 | It talks about how the code would have to work or not work if the list was not at all, and talks about how the list serves a purpose making the code easier to understand |
| **Procedural Abstraction** | 1 | 1 | There is a function with four different parameters, and in the second part of code uses that function to output things for the user, and they described the functionality of it |
| **Algorithm Implementation** | 1 | 1 | The segments of code show that they did actually use iteration, selection, and sequencing, and this person also explained how the algorithm works for other people |
| **Testing** | 1 | 1 | This person described what each call was in the code, and then talked about the conditions tested in each call, and then gave the results of both calls |

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Program Purpose and Function** | 1 | 0 | The input and the output of this program was shown in the video and was described in the written response, and they talked about the functionality of the program |
| **Data Abstraction** | 1 | 1 | There are two lists in the first program, and they are both used later in the second segment of code, and this list has more than one elements in it, and serves a purpose in the program |
| **Managing Complexity** | 1 | 1 | This person talked about how the code would be different if they did not use lists, and how it would be unnecessarily complex without lists because more parameters would be needed |
| **Procedural Abstraction** | 1 | 1 | There is one function in this code and there are 2 parameters in it, and then in the second segment that function is being called |
| **Algorithm Implementation** | 1 | 1 | This person goes in detail to explain how iteration, sequencing, and selection can all be seen within the code, and they also go into depth to explain how it applies |
| **Testing** | 1 | 1 | This part of the code describes two calls from the functions and the conditions being tested by the call, as well as the results and output of each call |

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Program Purpose and Function** | 1 | 1 | This Person actually used the input and output of the game, they also described the overall function and purpose of the program to keep |
| **Data Abstraction** | 0 | 1 | In this program, I do not really identify any lists and guesses is somewhat of an one-element list, and this does not really show the list being used in the second picture |
| **Managing Complexity** | 0 | 1 | This person talks about a list called wordList and I did not really see it in the first picture of code and I am not sure what exactly if they really described it in detail a lot. |
| **Procedural Abstraction** | 1 | 1 | In the first image, the code's function is made and then in the second segment it is being called with isitcorrect?(answer) and is then added to a list |
| **Algorithm Implementation** | 1 | 1 | This person did make an in detail explanation of their code explaning how they could actually make it, also it was a little hard to know if it is, but it seems the program uses iteration, selection, and sequencing |
| **Testing** | 1 | 1 | Two calls are being made in the code segments and it describes two calls to the procedure that was there, one of this is adding the answer to the guess list if correct, and the other is for the wrong one, they also describe the results of each |

# Takeaways
Similar to the past few performance task scoring assignments, I think I did a good job grading these performance tasks. Iâ€™ve gotten used to the CollegeBoard Rubric and I think I know how to get a program that fufills all of these programs. Knowing that actual people are grading our AP Exams, it can be determined that there can be different opinions. For example, on the first one, some people may think it deserves a 2, while some other people think it deserves a 4. This assignment just shows that the score one person thinks you got might not be your actual score, so it is important to review the rubric and try to get every single point.
