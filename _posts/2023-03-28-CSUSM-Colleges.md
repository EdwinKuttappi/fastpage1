# Background
On March 28th, 2023, some representatives came from California State University of San Marcos. I believe the purpose of these representatives were to get students interested in coming to CSUSM because of their majors. They wanted to attend a class that students were interested in that could lead to a STEM Major, this could get students interested in pursuing STEM Majors and get them interested.

# Notes
Here are some notes that I took during the 
 
I was very surprised to see how many students from APCSP and APCSA showed up today, I guess they all wanted the extra credit and wanted to learn more about the CSU System. I know that I personally wanted to learn more about the CSU system and find out how it compared to the UC System.

## Stories
- The representatives mentioned that they failed some of their classes but they did not give up, and they kept going on to pursue a STEM Major
- They failed STEM specific classes such as Calculus and Physics but they kept going on
- Despite failing, they were still able to obtain a PHD
- CalState helped them to gain a lot of knowledge and opened a whole door of opportunities

## CSUSM Fun Facts
- 18% of CSUSM is enrolled in the College of Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics
- California State University of San Marcos is a newer college
- They have a new Engineering Building and College
- This college is a national leader in social mobility
- One of my Spanish Teachers attended this university, and this is when I was first introduced to this college
- 

## Pathways and Departments
- CSUSM has many STEM focused pathways for students especially in Physics
- The pathways of CSUSM include
    - Chemistry
    - Biochemistry
    - Applied Physics
    - Electronics
    - Biology
    - Computer Science
    - Cybersecurity
    - Electrical Engineering
    - Mechanical Engineering
    - Computer Engineering
- The departments of CSUSM include
    - Physics
    - Chemistry
    - Biotechnology
    - Mathematics
    - Computer Science

## Addmittance Guidance
- Clubs are an important part of getting into a college
- You should join many clubs that pertain to your interests and that you should participate in them as much as possible
- CSUSM also has clubs available on campus
    - Cybersecurity Club
    - Robotics Club
    - 3D Printing Club
- Clubs that I am in are CTF Club, Robotics, Coding4Kidz, Chemistry Tutoring Club, Badminton Club, Del Norte Food Bank Club, Helping Hands, and Tech Space
- It is important to be in clubs during your undergraduate years
- Internships are a great way to get into college and they can really help you with your career
- The worst thing someone can say when you apply is that you are not qualified enough, that is not true, and that you should apply anyways
- Sometimes internships might not require a lot of knowledge where other internships may require knowledge or some courses such as Computer Science Principles
- Internships are an important way to be a part of research and help you get into college
- Google is a great resource for finding any internships
- Internships come in all shapes and sizes, and there is one for every field, but a lot of STEM focused internships

# Takeaways and Reflection
After listening to this panel, I have found myself becoming more and more excited about Computer Science. Based on prior experiences and events, I have learned many times that Computer Science can help you in so many different fields. I want to become a Mechanical Engineer when I grow up, and recently Westview held a similar event with CTE Panelists, I attended and afterwards I talked with a current Mechanical Engineer. He told me that there are so many different things he does, and knowing how to code was one of them, he says that Computer Science unlocks so many different skills, for example he is currently working on an Arduino Project, which is new to him, but with his prior knowledge, it is making it a lot easier to understand how to do it. To connect this to today's event, Kathyleen mentioned that although she works in a finance department, Computer Science has helped her to develop skills such as Critical Thinking which also led to being able to become a good Problem Solver. Additionally, Kris also mentioned that Continuous Learning was a good skill to have and that Computer Science has sort of exposed him to this way of learning allowing him to be an expert in different fields and understand different areas of work. 

To conclude, this event has really taught me that Computer Science is a very important skill even if you don't plan on taking a major with Computer Science. Even if you don't like Computer Science, taking this class can open your eyes up to so much more new perspectives and whenever you face a problem, you can look at it in the eyes of a programmer. Computer Science can help one to develop skills that is necessary in many other careers with the benefit of learning how to program. Personally, I think I should continue Computer Science even after High School. I have been keeping my eye on the Harvard Computer Science Class for a while, and I think this event has inspired me to finally start it.
