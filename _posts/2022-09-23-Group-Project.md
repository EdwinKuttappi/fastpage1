# Scrum Team Plans
For our project, all four of 4 us decided to use on of Emaad's ideas he had for the Creative Development Portion of the AP Exam, but we changed it a bit. The program will ask for input and a list of activites, and it will randomize that into an agenda for the user to follow.

## Roles
Scrum Master: Emaad Mir
DevOps: Luka Van Den Boomen
Frontend Developer: Edwin Abraham
Backend Developer: Jishnu Singiresu

My Role is the Frontend Developer which means that I work on the design portion of the project and make the program look appealing and user-friendly to anyone who wants to use it. In order to make this the best it can be, I will have to collaborate and share ideas a lot with Jishnu who is the backend developer.

## Program Idea and Purpose
The idea that we all have is making a list of activites that a user inputs into the program, and then that list is taken and put into an agenda. It is my job to make the agenda look nice and help the users to find out how to use it. The program will first ask the user for a list of activities they like, and then we can assign a variable to each one and put them in different places on the agenda and output that so that way the user has a way to do all the activities they love and having a lot of variety.
