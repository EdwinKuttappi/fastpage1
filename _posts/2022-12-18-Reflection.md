## Reflection
I really liked this lesson and I learned some things from them. I already knew a lot before this lesson because of the final exam. I got questions regarding this topic wrong on the final exam, so I reviewed it and understood it. This is why this lesson was pretty easy for me.

## Reflection
Overall, this lesson was really fun and I really liked it. I did understand a lot and I already knew most of the information, but I learned more from this section than the one from before.
