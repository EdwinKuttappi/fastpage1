Comments: Completed everything accurately and did extra binary hacks

## Reflection
I really liked this lesson and I learned some things from them. I already knew a lot before this lesson because of the final exam. I got questions regarding this topic wrong on the final exam, so I reviewed it and understood it. This is why this lesson was pretty easy for me.

## Reflection
Overall, this lesson was really fun and I really liked it. I did understand a lot and I already knew most of the information, but I learned more from this section than the one from before.

## Reflection
This lesson was pretty simple and I think it was the most well organized one out of them all. I liked that we got to do a flowchart. I learned a lot about JavaScript and Python. The only thing I had a little trouble with were the Binary Truth Tables

# Unit 3 Sections 8 and 10
This Group: Varalu, Advay, Rohin, and Ryan

Comments: Nice flowchart, completed all work with good explanations

## Reflection
The presentation done by this group was pretty simple, I felt that I understood most of what they said. For the things I did not understand, I went back into their notes and tried to understand what they did. I had a lot of trouble with Exercise 2 but managed to do it. The quiz they had was pretty easy and I was also very impressed with the UI of the quiz.

Comments: I don't think your reverse list (w/o list.reverse()) or bubble sort algorithms work as intended. Also f-strings are used differently

## Reflection
I felt like this was the lesson that I paid the most attention too, this was good because I knew what was being taught, and could keep up with the class. It wasn't so much that I did not already know, but I just was able to follow along really well with the lesson and could understand the algorithms and the pseudocode in the lesson.
