My Score: **1/1**

Graded by **Amitha**

Comments: Completed everything accurately and did extra binary hacks

## Reflection
I really liked this lesson and I learned some things from them. I already knew a lot before this lesson because of the final exam. I got questions regarding this topic wrong on the final exam, so I reviewed it and understood it. This is why this lesson was pretty easy for me.

Comments: Updated blog to have nice explanations, good work.

## Reflection
Overall, this lesson was really fun and I really liked it. I did understand a lot and I already knew most of the information, but I learned more from this section than the one from before.

My Score: **1/1**

Comments: Nice flowchart, completed all work with good explanations

## Reflection
This lesson was pretty simple and I think it was the most well organized one out of them all. I liked that we got to do a flowchart. I learned a lot about JavaScript and Python. The only thing I had a little trouble with were the Binary Truth Tables

Comments: I don't think your reverse list (w/o list.reverse()) or bubble sort algorithms work as intended. Also f-strings are used differently

## Reflection
The presentation done by this group was pretty simple, I felt that I understood most of what they said. For the things I did not understand, I went back into their notes and tried to understand what they did. I had a lot of trouble with Exercise 2 but managed to do it. The quiz they had was pretty easy and I was also very impressed with the UI of the quiz.

# Unit 3 Sections 9 and 11
This Group: Eli, Samarth, Khalid, and Trent

[Unit 3 Sections 9 and 11 Hacks](https://github.com/EdwinKuttappi/fastpage1/blob/master/_posts/2022-12-06-Section9%2611.md)

My Score: **0.93/1**

Graded By: Trent

Comments: Extensive notes and great explanations for each of the answers

## Reflection
I felt like this was the lesson that I paid the most attention too, this was good because I knew what was being taught, and could keep up with the class. It wasn't so much that I did not already know, but I just was able to follow along really well with the lesson and could understand the algorithms and the pseudocode in the lesson.

# Unit 3 Sections 12 and 13
This Group: Caleb, James, Qais, and Krishiv

[Unit 3 Sections 12 and 13 Hacks](https://github.com/EdwinKuttappi/fastpage1/blob/master/_notebooks/2022-12-08-Section12%2613.ipynb)

My Score: **0.9/1**

Graded By: James

Comments: Completed all of the hacks and took notes and explained each answer and showed a good understanding

## Reflection
This lesson was all about procedures and this is an important part of the CollegeBoard AP Exam because pseudocode includes a lot of procedures and this is important. If you do not understand these procedures, you should work on it because this lesson was beneficial to my understanding of what I need to do.

# Unit 3 Sections 14 and 15
This Group: Emma, Sanika, Ishi, and Leonard 

[Unit 3 Sections 14 and 15 Hacks](https://github.com/EdwinKuttappi/fastpage1/blob/master/_notebooks/2022-12-12-Section14%2615.ipynb)

Comments: The reflection was really polished and showed a high level of understanding

## Reflection
This lesson was pretty simple and it was easy because I know a lot about variables and I use it all the time. I also learned a lot about Documentation and the importance of using it in your code. I also learned a lot about the random function, and how important and commonly used it is.
