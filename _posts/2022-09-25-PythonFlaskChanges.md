# Changing and Customizing my own Python Flask Home Page
I went to the index.html file and I was able to learn what each code was doing and I saw that you could code a card and I decided to add another code under the heading About Me. I also went in to the headings and changed them to make them more about me and show what I wanted to focus on.

After adding another card on the bottom, I changed it to make it about me, so anyone reading the website can learn more about me.

# Changing and Customizing my Stub.html file
I know that stub is just a generic term and that is just a word to name the file. For this page, I did not really have an idea for what to do, so I just wrote some quick things about me
