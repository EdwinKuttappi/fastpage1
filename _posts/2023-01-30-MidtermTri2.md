# Taking the Multiple Choice Test
We were assigned a 50 Question Multiple Choice Test in preparation for the AP Exam and we know what to expect on that day. When I got to class on Friday, two of my groupmates had already finished it, and I knew I had to work on it over the long weekend The questions were not too hard, but we spent a lot of time collaborating and explaining our answers to make sure the other one got it. I did this pretty quickly and finished quicker than expected and when I submitted I got a /50.

# Test Corrections
After I submitted the test, I got a 43/50 (86%), which was around what I thought I would get. I was hoping to get an A, but I guess this means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/finalexamtri1score.png)

1.D: 1/2 (50.0%)

2.B: 5/7 (71.4%)

3.A: 7/8 (87.5%)

3.C: 3/4 (75.0%)

4.A: 4/6 (66.7%)

I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don't understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right.
