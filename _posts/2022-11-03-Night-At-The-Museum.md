# Background
Our Night at the Museum was on November 3rd, 2022, at 6:00pm-7:30pm. I had to take a 30 minute shift with the rest of my group and help explain our group project. We are in Period 4 with Mr. Mortensen so we had  We had two laptops on display so that way we could present to more people easier. Our Project was a calendar and we used a frontend and a backend for it. Our [backend](https://agenda.nighthawkcodescrums.gq/) was where we had to store our data for the calendar and then we had to show it on our [frontend](https://emaad-mir.github.io/ttitans-fastpages/), and in order to get the data from the backend, we had to use fetch commands to get the data to show and save our calendar. I was a Frontend Developer so I worked a lot on the frontend and making it look nice.

## Presenting our Flask Site
[Backend](https://agenda.nighthawkcodescrums.gq/)
We did not really present our backend site, the main purpose of the site was to have it run and use it as a place to store the data that the frontend had. In order to use the backend, we had to get off the School Wifi because it had the firewall which blocked AWS which was the host we used for the backend. We quickly went over this site if there were any people who wanted to know more about our project and how we did it.

## Presenting our Fastpage Site
[Frontend](https://edwinkuttappi.github.io/fastpage1/categories/)
This was the site we used mainly for our users to interact with. If you go to the website you can use our project and see what exactly 

# Looking at other Projects
After 6:30, we could go, but I brought my sister with me and she wanted to see the art and other projects. We first looked at other computer science projects and used them, but after that we went to other classes such as Ceramics, 3D Animation, and AP Studio Art.
