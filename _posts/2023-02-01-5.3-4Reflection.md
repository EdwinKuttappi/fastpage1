# Overview of the Discussion
This discussion was pretty simple and was a little different that it was last week, because we had an inner circle and an outer circle. It was nice to be able to talk to different people and hear their perspectives. Afterwards, the whole class would discuss the two CollegeBoard topics, and this helped me to understand each topic.

## Section 5.3
**HP Laptop Facial Recognition**

1. Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? If yes or no, justify you conclusion.

No, I do not think that the owner of this computer thought it was intentional because he might've just thought it was a flaw, but there is a small chance he thought it was intentional because it was working for his coworker in the not ideal lighting.

2. How do you think this happened?
I think that this happened because this webcam is old and during testing, they did very little and focused more on recognizing facial features rather than focusing on skin color. They probably tested it in ideal conditions and just focusing on facial features, but didn't think about facial features of people of color in unideal questions.

3. Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
I believe this is harmful to both the consumers and the company, because once the consumers buy it and try out this feature they will be dissapointed and buy ohter products from other companies. People will stop being loyal to HP. This means that HP will lose some customers and the people will be sad that they are not.

3. Should it be corrected?
It should be corrected so that way people will be loyal to the company

4. What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
**Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write**
