# Overview of the Discussion
This discussion was pretty simple and was a little different that it was last week, because we had an inner circle and an outer circle. It was nice to be able to talk to different people and hear their perspectives. Afterwards, the whole class would discuss the two CollegeBoard topics, and this helped me to understand each topic.

## Section 5.3

**Age Groups: Facebook and Instagram**

Although Facebook and Instagram are both from the same company and are popular social media with similar purposes, Instagram is for younger people while Facebook is for older people. This makes it easier for advertisers to advertise towards a certain age group. This is good bussiness because people will use a certain app based on their age and get to interact with others online around their age, so they will tend to use that app more.

**Virtual Assistants**

Usually, Virtual Assistants come with a Female Voice by default, but I am pretty sure that you can change the voice of these virtual assistants. So I don't think it is as harmful as it would be if it was only female voices because consumers can always change the voice.

**Company Algorithms**

Two companies that work together that I have seen are Amazon and Google. For example, I googled Professional Table Tennis Paddles, and then a few minutes later, I would open Amazon and then on the home page would show a Table Tennis Paddle. This is very easy to order from Amazon, and this might influence where I would buy a Table Tennis Paddle.

**HP Laptop Facial Recognition**

1. Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? If yes or no, justify you conclusion.

No, I do not think that the owner of this computer thought it was intentional because he might've just thought it was a flaw, but there is a small chance he thought it was intentional because it was working for his coworker in the not ideal lighting.

2. How do you think this happened?
I think that this happened because this webcam is old and during testing, they did very little and focused more on recognizing facial features rather than focusing on skin color. They probably tested it in ideal conditions and just focusing on facial features, but didn't think about facial features of people of color in unideal questions.

3. Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
I believe this is harmful to both the consumers and the company, because once the consumers buy it and try out this feature they will be dissapointed and buy ohter products from other companies. People will stop being loyal to HP. This means that HP will lose some customers and the people will be sad that they are not.

3. Should it be corrected?
It should be corrected so that way people will be loyal to the company, because if consumers like everything else about the product, except this webcam, if this were to be corrected, then consumers might starting buying products frm them again.

4. What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
In order to produce a better outcome, we should do a lot of testing with people who don't have a lot of experience with traveling and those that do, so we can see how their interactions are different, and use that to improve on the website.

**Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write**
