# CollegeBoard Unit: Program Design and Development
There is a lot of development that has to go into programs to make the user interactions easier. CRD - 2.E.1 says that a development process can be ordered and intentional or exploratory in nature. CRD 2.E.2 says that there are multiple development processes. the following phases are commonly used when developing a program: investigating and reflecting, designing, prototyping, and testing. CRD 2.F.3 also says that some ways investigation can be performed are with collecting data through surveys, user testing, interviews, and direct observations. CRD - 2.H.1 says that it is important to acknowledge any code segments that were developed collaboratively or by another source.

## CollegeBoard Videos 1.3 Videos 1, 2, and 3

Video 1:
- A program is always developed with an idea
- The idea always has a **specific purpose** in the mind and the people think about what they want to do and follow some steps
- Developers are trying to stick to their plan and follow some specific steps
- The Development can be very exploratory and the steps followed are based on what happens, people who are observing early AI Projects look for things to improve on and they try to make changes that might be useful
- When making a program, developers have to determine the requirements of the program, understand the constraints like time, understand the user concerns and interests
- Developers design the program by **brainstorming**, **storyboarding**, planning user experience, laying out the user interface, organizing into modules, and develop a testing strategy
- Developers have to choose how a program should behave and include a list of user interactions

Video 2:
- Programs are developed by groups of people and groups use programming from other people and make it for themselves, but they must give credit
- Different people or teams work on different components and they all work together as a team
- When working in a team, credit must be given to people who were a part of the program, and documentation helps when fixing things and so that person gets credit
- The program documentation should include the author's name and the source of the code segments used


Video 3:
- A program is a collection of statements, which is a single command
- A group of statements is called a code segment
- A program is often referred to as software
- Code Segments need to work for a variety of different lists, like lists that include numbers out of order, negative numbers, large numbers, or decimals
- Descriptions of programs should have comments and should say what it does to help others and yourself, it can explain why in detail it works

## CollegeBoard Quiz: Collaboration Quiz
I took the CollegeBoard quiz about Collaboration and out of the 6 questions, I got 4 of the questions right showing that I somewhat understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make collaborating with my group more efficient. I got question 4 and 6 wrong, but for question 4, I did not really look at one of the statements, so I think I should've have gotten that right, but for Question 6, I did not know how to read the code.

## Takeaways
There is a specific purpose for Developers when they are making a program and they have to do a lot of things. They also need to think about a lot and what they can add or change. They also need to do a lot of testing. Developers make a lot of additions based on feedback or they thought of improving something.
