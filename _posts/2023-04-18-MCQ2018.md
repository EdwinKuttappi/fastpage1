# Taking the Multiple Choice Test
We were assigned a 50 Question Multiple Choice Test in preparation for the AP Exam and we know what to expect on that day. This was assigned on a Friday, but we had until the next Monday to finish it. Many of my groupmates had started it and I worked with some of them to get maybe the first 15 questions done, but I had to I did this pretty quickly and finished quicker than expected and when I submitted I got a 61/66 (92.4%).

# Test Corrections
After I submitted the test, I got 61/66 (92%), and I was surprised that I only got five problems wrong, most of the questions were easy but I did not know how to answer them some of them, especially ones that were about Big Idea 4. I did get an A, but I should also work on improving those other concepts. This means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills.

I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don't understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right.

## Question 14
**Topic 3.9**: Developing Algorithms

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: A, The programs display different values.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: C, The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.

## Question 46
**Topic 3.18**: Undecidable Problems

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: A, It is not possible to create an algorithm to solve an undecidable problem for all programs and inputs.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: D, An undecidable problem is one in which no algorithm can be constructed that always leads to a correct yes-or-no answer.

## Question 47
**Topic 5.6**: Safe Computing

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: B, The sender’s private key cannot be used to decrypt the message.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: D, In public cryptography, a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key and decrypted with the recipient’s private key.

## Question 60
**Topic 3.13**: Developing Procedure

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: A and C, Placing repeated code with procedure calls is an example of a procedural abstraction that may make it easier for a programmer to manage the complexity of a program. Placing all documentation in a single line does not help a programmer to manage the complexity of a program.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: A and D, Placing repeated code with procedure calls is an example of a procedural abstraction that may make it easier for a programmer to manage the complexity of a program. Creating a list of names is an example of a data abstraction that may make it easier for a programmer to manage the complexity of a program.

## Question 64
**Topic 5.1**: Beneficial and Harmful Effects

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: C and D, Cloud computing sites must consider security concerns in order to protect their users’ private data Cloud storage sites allow users to share files easily, which could lead to increased concerns about copyrighted materials being illegally distributed online.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: B and C, Cloud computing fosters new ways to communicate and collaborate, allowing users to share files and tools easily. Cloud computing sites must consider security concerns in order to protect their users’ private data.

# Confusing Problems

## Question 2
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/midtermquestion2.png)

I did not understand the purpose of the program and I had to try and guess what could be changed in order to find out the answer. On this question, I had to guess the answer because I did not know what would make sure the output of the code would stay the same.

## Question 16
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/midtermquestion16.png)

This question was a complete guess because I had no idea what each one meant completely, I had an idea of each one, but I wasn't sure why the answer was selection, I knew it couldn't be iteration because that would help with the even number, and I had to guess between the other three choices, and I was right. I still do not understand but maybe I can understand by looking at someone else's test corrections.

## Question 30
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/midtermquestion30.png)

This question was very hard and I did not really understand what the question was asking and I had no idea what I had to do. I got this question right but I did not know why it was B and C, all I knew was that it was not A or D because the circles did not line up.

# Reflection on the Exam
Overall, the test was pretty easy and I am happy with ny score, but I should try to get a higher score. If I paid attention a little more, I think I could have understood the questions a bit more I think I went through this test pretty slowly because I did not really understand each question and I had to read it a lot of times. I think I can do well on the AP Exam if I find out what exactly I need to do and keep reviewing the content, spend less time on each problem.
