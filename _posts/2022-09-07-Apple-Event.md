# Apple's Far Out Event
On September 7th, 2022, Apple held a Far Out Event where they introduced the iPhone 14, Airpods Pro 2, and 3 new Apple Watches.

# Apple iPhones
This year, I saw a model of what the iPhone 14's would look like and I was not sure whether Apple would actually do that. The render showed the phone with not one, but two cutout notches, one in a circular shape, and next to it in another oval shape. I did not think Apple would do this, but they did with the Pro Models, and used this new hardware to improve their software with Dynamic Island, and instead of leaving screen between the two cutouts, they filled it with black to make it seem like one big oval cutout.

## iPhone 14
On this day, Apple announced 4 new iPhones, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max. This year they did not include an iPhone 14 mini, this is probably because they thought they didn't need it anymore. However, one thing to note is that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus come with the Apple A15 Chip which is the same chip as the iPhone 13 and the iPhone 13 mini. However, the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro Max come with the newer A16 chip.

## iPhone 14 Plus
Instead of the iPhone 14 mini, Apple decided to launch the iPhone 14 Plus which basically was the iPhone 14 but bigger and had a battery size for $100 more. I think they did this was because the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 mini were not selling as much as they had wanted, and for this new plus phone, I think the same will happen as well.

## iPhone 14 Pro
I was surprised with this phone because of the new Dynamic Island. There were images that the notch would be a circle cutout and then an oval cutout, and I thought it wouldn't happen, but it did, but instead they filled the space in between, to look like it was together, and it was one big oval in the middle of the phone.

## iPhone 14 Pro Max
Just like recent years, Apple has released a Pro Max version of this years iPhone, which is the same as the iPhone 14 Pro but has a bigger screen and battery. This is the biggest phone that Apple released this year, and it is probably the best phone you can get from Apple this year.

# Apple Watches
Apple introduced three new apple watches. The Apple Watch SE (Starting at $299), Apple Watch Series 8 (Starting at $399), and the Apple Watch Ultra (Starting at $799). I was not really expecting the Apple Watch Ultra, but I was impressed with the look of it. All of these Apple Watches come with new Safety Detection Features just like with the new iPhones

## Apple Watch SE
This Apple Watch is the budget apple watch for those people who don't necessarily want to spend or need all of the other features. One big key thing Apple focused on during this event was Safety, especially with Crash Detection and Emergency SOS. Apple brought Crash Detection to this model and all the other apple watches announced here during this event

## Apple Watch Series 8
The Apple Watch Series 8 with a newer processor than last year and it has a temperature sensor. This watch also has crash detection so if it has detected you are in a crash it will notify first responders. It is also now capable of Bluetooth 5.3. This new watch comes with the S8 chip, but this does have the same CPU as the S7 Chip. It also comes with a newer and more powerful gyroscope and a high dynamic range accelerator, probably for the new safety features. Some thing this watch has now is a body temperature sensor, which was not on the Apple Watch Series 7.

## Apple Watch Ultra
I was not expecting this watch at all, I was wondering what the purpose of this watch was, and it is for super dedicated athletes. I remember first seeing it at school during lunch and really liked the bands of the Series 8 Watch, but not so much the shape of the actual watch. Then I realized it was a whole new watch, and was made for professional athletes.

# Airpods Pro 2
During this event, Apple also announced a new generation of the Apple Airpods Pro's which has the same look as the original ones, but the case now supports MagSafe Charging. Additionally, these new earbuds have improved noise cancellation and better sound quality. These improved earbuds now have richer bass. One big feature we have seen here is adaptive transparency mode which lets you hear some outside, but not all of them.
