# Apple's Far Out Event
On September 7th, 2022, Apple held a Far Out Event where they introduced the iPhone 14, Airpods Pro 2, and 3 new Apple Watches.

# iPhone 14
On this day, Apple announced 4 new iPhones, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max. This year they did not include an iPhone 14 mini, this is probably because they thought they didn't need it anymore. However, one thing to note is that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus come with the Apple A15 Chip which is the same chip as the iPhone 13 and the iPhone 13 mini. However, the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 14 Pro Max come with the newer A16 chip.

# Apple Watches
Apple introduced three new apple watches. The Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 8, and the Apple Watch Ultra.

## Apple Watch Series 8
The first was the Apple Watch Series 8 with a newer processor than last year and it has a temperature sensor. This watch also has crash detection so if it has detected you are in a crash it will notify first responders. It is also now capable of Bluetooth 5.3.
