# Code.org AppLab

We were told to design an app using Code.org with an App Lab. I opened the App Lab and then went to the design tab and added a button to start the quiz. This picture below shows what the window looked like and by the end of this app, I hope it looks much better

## AppLab Part 1 - The Design of Homepage and Instructions
I also made a new screen for the rules and how to play page and I added code to make sure when the button was clicked it would switch to the rules and how to play the quiz. Here is a picture of what my homepage looks like

This is a picture of what my instruction page looks like and i used the same code as I did for the first button, I just changed it a little bit to make sure the code detected the right button.
