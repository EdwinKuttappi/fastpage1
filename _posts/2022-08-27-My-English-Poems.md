# Last week in American Literature 1

This past week, we had to write two poems in my class, one was finding words from a poem and combining them to make a big poem.

The other poem was to write an actual poem using your own words

I would like to share both poems, but the second one is not done, so I will share it once it is done

## The First Poem

This First Poem's words were taken from 'Common Sense' by Thomas Paine
