# Last week in American Literature 1

This past week, we had to write two poems in my class, one was finding words from a poem and making one from that, and then we had to make two new poems with our words.

The other poem was to write an actual poem using your own words

## The First Poem about Immigration
An Immigrant Coincidence
I came to America in hope for this promised life
Once I arrived everything was out of sight
Treated like an outstander with a lowlife
I applied for a job but had to put up a fight

They directed me towards the department of agriculture
With no friends, I sought a subculture
Found myself surrounded by those with a similar incidence
I don't think this was a coincidence

I feel I have found my place
Where everyone is alike with the same mission
The relationship between us is like a baseball team trying to go to base
Crowds of people all with a comforting smile, I finally feel recognition

Though this country may have a bell that rings liberty
It reminds me of the taste of bitter tea
So I say this country is only as good as it’s people

## The Second Poem about Immigration
Shielded from the Warfare
I thought this new world would be a place to call home
But I have no freedom to roam
At the park, I saw a bald eagle
An American Symbol, yet making me feel illegal

I thought this country would be full of opportunities
Hoping to make use of all the amenities
Despite the uninviting feeling
It does feel a little freewheeling

I thought this country would make me smaller
Yet every day I feel more like a scholar
The education here is like none other
It feels great to not have to suffer

I thought this country wouldn’t care
All of this to get away from warfare
When I got here, all I could think of was being free
The thought of getting a college degree

I thought this country would provide me with a shield
And it has helped me become healed
I am still discovering my capability
Overjoyed with all the possibilities
