# Taking the Multiple Choice Test

# Test Corrections
After I submitted the test, I got a 43/50 (86%), which was around what I thought I would get. I was hoping to get an A, but I guess this means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills.

1.D: 1/2 (50.0%)
2.B: 5/7 (71.4%)
3.A: 7/8 (87.5%)
3.C: 3/4 (75.0%)
4.A: 4/6 (66.7%)
I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don't understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right.

## Question 6
**Topic 1.3**: Program Design and Development

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Option D
Incorrect. The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so only values less than or equal to max are printed.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Option B
Correct. The procedure initializes count to 1. Inside the loop, the value of count is displayed, then count is incremented by 2 to the next odd integer. The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so all positive odd integers less than or equal to max are printed.

## Question 11
**Topic 1.2**: Program Function and Purpose

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Option D
Incorrect. The inner loop iterates from index j + 1 to the end of the list, so each element is compared with all the elements that follow it, not just the one element that immediately precedes it.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Option B
Correct. The algorithm traverses myList using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from the first element in the list to the second-to-last element in the list. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop compares that element to every subsequent element in the array.

## Question 20
**Topic 2.1**: Binary Numbers

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Option B
Incorrect. Four bits can represent 24, or 16 pieces of information, so it is not necessary to add extra bits.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Option D
Correct. Four bits can represent 24, or 16 pieces of information.

## Question 21
**Topic 2.1**: Binary Numbers

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Option A
Incorrect. Statement II is true because colors can be encoded as sequences of bits. Statement III is true because sequences of bits can be used to represent sound.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Option D
Correct. All digital data is represented at the lowest level as sequences of bits. Statement I is true because strings of characters can be represented by sequences of bits. Statement II is true because colors can be encoded as sequences of bits. Statement III is true because sequences of bits can be used to represent sound.

## Question 36
**Topic 3.10**: Lists

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Option D
Incorrect. This would be the correct solution if i were initialized to 0 instead of 1. This code segment will generate the list [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22].

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Option C
Correct. For the first iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 2, is appended to evenList, and then i is incremented to 2. For the second iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 4, is appended to the list, and then i is incremented to 3. This continues eight more times, appending the next eight even numbers to evenList. This code segment will generate the list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20].

## Question 37
**Topic 3.3**: Mathematical Expressions

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Option A
Incorrect. A temporary variable is needed to interchange the values of two variables.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Option D
Correct. The first statement assigns the value of num1 to the temporary variable temp. The second statement assigns the value of num2 to num1. The third statement assigns the original value of num1, which is stored in temp, to num2. The original values of num1 to num2 are interchanged.

## Question 39
**Topic 3.2**: Data Abstraction

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: Option C
Incorrect. List indices are typically nonnegative integers, so a decimal number between two integers would be considered an invalid index.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: Option D
Correct. List indices are typically nonnegative integers. The exam reference sheet describes a list structure whose index values are 1 through the number of elements in the list, inclusive. So, 4 would be considered a valid index.
