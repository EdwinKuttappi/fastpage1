# Taking the Multiple Choice Test

# Test Corrections
After I submitted the test, I got a 43/50 (86%), which was around what I thought I would get. I was hoping to get an A, but I guess this means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills.

1.D: 1/2 (50.0%)
2.B: 5/7 (71.4%)
3.A: 7/8 (87.5%)
3.C: 3/4 (75.0%)
4.A: 4/6 (66.7%)
I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don't understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right.
