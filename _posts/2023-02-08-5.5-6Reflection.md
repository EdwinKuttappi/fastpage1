# Overview of the Discussion
This discussion was similar to the one that we had last week and this was just talking about Legal and Ethical Concerns as well as Safe Computing. We talked about copyright and how legal methods are used to get information about people.

## Section 5.5
1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.

I saw two different tyoes of licensing from Github, Creative Commons License, MIT licensing, and GPL License. These licenses are what makes sure that people can get credited for their work and make sure they know when their work is distributed. The creative commons license doesn't allow copyrighting and is given out for public use. MIT License is a closed source however, and it can be distributed but the owner should get credit for their work

2. In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.

3. Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.

## Section 5.4
**Obtaining Data and Crowdsourcing**

We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through APIâ€™s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used.

API's I have used are the Google Maps API, and a bunch of other APIs when I first started using APIs for APCSP, I did not really understand how they all worked, and I was really confused, but I still worked around it and did it.

We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub?

I have used Github to look at other people's code and try to use that in my code. One of the biggest things I have found in Github was code for Del Norte's Robotics Team, and I opened this up to see how exactly, their team coded a robot.

Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting?

I saw a lot of different datasets that had many different topics, and this is important because many people can use it for any ideas they have. Crowd Data might make us choose where we might want to eat or go. For example, if two Italian Restuarants are nearby to you, and you want to go to to one, you will probably choose the one with a higher rating.

**Crowdsourcing in my Project**

**CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?**

In our classes, we have many students, and this can really help us improve our testing because we can introduce much diversity. We will get many different ideas and will be able to find out what exactly users are looking for and start to implement them. Another idea is using all these students for help with feedback and with coding for this project. We can make our repository more open to people in our classes and ask them to add some features. We can also use Pull Requests and ask people to review the Pull Request and ask people if they think that feature will be beneficial. Another thing that we can do is make a form and ask people to fill it out with feedback about our website.

**What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?**
If my group and I were able to crowdsource all of Del Norte, this would be very helpful because then we get feedback from students who have no computer science experience and we also get much more diversity in our testing. By opening it up to more people, we can get more suggestions to make our project better.

**What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.**

Some data I could capture would be how many people come to our area to check out our website. I can look at how other groups are inviting others to come by and comparing it to others. I can compare our website to those who have a website attracting much more people, and then ask myself what makes their website more appealing.
