| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Program Purpose and Function** | 1 | 1 | This person did not really tell us what exactly the purpose was but on the written portion they just stated the functionality, and they did show the input and the output |
| **Data Abstraction** | 1 | 1 | There are two code segments used in this program, and one is a list, the use of lists here have helped to classify the type of triangle that it is, this person did include everything so I believe they deserve the point |
| **Managing Complexity** | 0 | 1 | This person's solution to the program without the list is not really that great, and the use of a list does not really seem like it is making the program any easier, instead of returning a list, they could've just used a string |
| **Procedural Abstraction** | 0 | 1 | Did not really talk about the overall functionality of the program while also talking about what the procedure does, and it is then used in a really inefficient way, but the parameter is there and is defined |
| **Algorithm Implementation** | 0 | 1 | This person was able to implement the code and explain it all very well, but they did not really show sequencing that much, but I did see a lot of iteration and some selection in the program |
| **Testing** | 1 | 1 | This person has included a lot of information about the two calls, and they were able to identify the result of each call with the use of implicit and explicit parameters, and different parts of the code are being run  |
