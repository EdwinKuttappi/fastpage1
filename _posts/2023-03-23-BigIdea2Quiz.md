# Taking the Multiple Choice Test
We were assigned a 25 Question Multiple Choice Test in preparation for the AP Exam and we know what to expect on that day. This was assigned on a Thursday, and I started it on the Friday afterwards, I finished 22 of the questions and then I forgot to to finish it. We had until the next Thursday to finish it. I worked with one of my groupmates, Luka, and we both collaborated on some questions. I was able to finish 22 questions, but when CollegeBoard automatically submitted it for me, my score was 20/25(80.0%).

# Test Corrections
After I submitted the test, I got a 20/25 (80.0%), and I was surprised that I only got two problems wrong without counting the questions I had skipped. Most of the questions were easy but I did not know how to answer them some of them. I did get an B, but could've been an A if I finished. I should also work on improving those other concepts. This means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills.

1.D: 4/4 (100.0%)

2.B: 4/8 (50.0%)

5.B: 9/10 (90.0%)

5.D: 3/3 (100.0%)

I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don't understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right.

## Question 17
**Topic 2.4**: Using Programs with Data

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: B, This information can be determined using the data collected, but not the way described in this option. One way to determine the method of payment that was used in the greatest number of transactions during the 7-day period is to sort the data by the method of payment as described. Instead of adding the number of items purchased for each type of payment, a count of each payment type needs to be computed. If the counts are stored in a new field, then the counts can be sorted to find the method of payment used in the greatest number of transactions.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: D, For each transaction, the data includes the date of the transaction and the number of items purchased in the transaction. By searching the data to find all transactions that occurred on the given date, and then adding the number of items purchased in each of those transactions, the total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined.

## Question 21
**Topic 2.4**: Using Programs with Data

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: B and C, Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Sorting by year will sort the remaining entries in column C from least to greatest, putting the photograph with the lowest year value in the first row of the spreadsheet. This sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: B and D, Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Sorting by year will sort the remaining entries in column C from least to greatest, putting the photograph with the lowest year value in the first row of the spreadsheet. Sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet.

## Question 23
**Topic 2.4**: Using Programs with Data

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: N/A, To be counted, a show must be a talk show that airs on Saturday or Sunday. Therefore, the AND operator should be used instead of the first OR operator. To be counted, a show must be a talk show that is on Saturday or Sunday. Therefore, the AND operator should be used instead of the first OR operator. In addition, it is not possible for day to be equal to both "Saturday" and "Sunday", so the AND operator should be an OR operator. It is not possible for day to be equal to both "Saturday" and "Sunday", so the second AND operator should be an OR operator.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: B, For a show to be counted, the value of genre must be "talk" and the value of day must be "Saturday" or "Sunday".

## Question 24
**Topic 2.1**: Binary Numbers

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: N/A, I did not answer this question because I forgot to finish the quiz and the quiz automatically submitted for me. If I did answer this question, I am pretty sure that I would have got it right because I can just change the binary number into decimal, and then add one, and find the binary number of that.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: A, the answer should be 1001 0100 because the ID of the previous student is 1001 0011 which converts to 147, and then we add one because that is the ID of the next student, so that is 148. The binary number of 148 is 1001 0100, and this is what Option A is.

## Question 25
**Topic 2.1**: Binary Numbers

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: N/A, Appending three 0s to a decimal number multiplies it by 1,000. Appending three 0s to the end of a binary number multiplies it by 23. Incorrect. Appending three 0s to the end of a binary number multiplies it by 23, not by 4. Appending three 0s to the end of a binary number multiplies it by 23, not by 3.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: C, Appending a 0 to the end of a binary number multiplies the number by 2. Therefore, appending three 0s to the end of a binary number multiples the number by 2 three times, which is the same as multiplying the number by 8.

# Confusing Problems

## Question 2
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/midtermquestion2.png)

I did not understand the purpose of the program and I had to try and guess what could be changed in order to find out the answer. On this question, I had to guess the answer because I did not know what would make sure the output of the code would stay the same.

## Question 16
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bigidea2question22.png)

This question was a complete guess because I had no idea what each one meant completely, I had an idea of each one, but I wasn't sure why the answer was selection, I knew it couldn't be iteration because that would help with the even number, and I had to guess between the other three choices, and I was right. I still do not understand but maybe I can understand by looking at someone else's test corrections.

## Question 30
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/midtermquestion30.png)

This question was very hard and I did not reallt understand what the question was asking and I had no idea what I had to do. I got this question right but I did not know why it was B and C, all I knew was that it was not A or D because the circles did not line up.

# Reflection on the Exam
Overall, the test was pretty easy and I am happy with ny score, but I should try to get a higher score. If I paid attention a little more, I think I could have understood the questions a bit more I think I went through this test pretty slowly because I did not really understand each question and I had to read it a lot of times. I think I can do well on the AP Exam if I find out what exactly I need to do and keep reviewing the content, spend less time on each problem.
