# Taking the Multiple Choice Test
We were assigned a 25 Question Multiple Choice Test in preparation for the AP Exam and we know what to expect on that day. This was assigned on a Thursday, and I started it on the Friday afterwards, I finished 22 of the questions and then I forgot to to finish it. We had until the next Thursday to finish it. I worked with one of my groupmates, Luka, and we both collaborated on some questions. I was able to finish 22 questions, but when CollegeBoard automatically submitted it for me, my score was 20/25(80.0%).

# Test Corrections
After I submitted the test, I got a 20/25 (80.0%), and I was surprised that I only got two problems wrong without counting the questions I had skipped. Most of the questions were easy but I did not know how to answer them some of them. I did get an B, but could've been an A if I finished. I should also work on improving those other concepts. This means I should work harder towards trying to understand why I got these questions wrong and remember them. Whenever I got questions wrong, they were usually from the same skill showing that I could use some practice in specific skills.

1.D: 4/4 (100.0%)

2.B: 4/8 (50.0%)

5.B: 9/10 (90.0%)

5.D: 3/3 (100.0%)

I can take a look at the notes I took for each section, especially from the ones I got wrong. If I don't understand it from my notes, I can always go back to the CollegeBoard Videos and rewatch it. Additionally, when I was doing test corrections I could look at the reason why my answer was wrong, and why the correct answer was right.

## Question 17
**Topic 2.4**: Using Programs with Data

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: A, this option is incorrect. Statement III is also correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: C, this option is correct. Statement I is correct because the Creative Commons license is designed to increase the amount of content available to the public for free. Statement III is correct because under Creative Commons the author can stipulate what kind of modification is allowed by users.

## Question 21
**Topic 2.4**: Using Programs with Data

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: C, this option is incorrect. Compression techniques are not used in the addition of numbers.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: A, this option is correct. The binary representations (in 3 bits) of 5 and 3 are 101 and 011, respectively. If these numbers are added, the result would be 1000. Since only 3 bits are used to represent integers in this example, the result would be stored as 000. This is an example of overflow error.

## Question 23
**Topic 2.4**: Using Programs with Data

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: B, this option is correct. The binary representations (in 3 bits) of 5 and 3 are 101 and 011, respectively. If these numbers are added, the result would be 1000. Since only 3 bits are used to represent integers in this example, the result would be stored as 000. This is an example of overflow error.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: A, correct. If scoreA is greater than both scoreB and scoreC (the first two IF clauses), then Team A wins. If scoreA is greater than scoreB but not greater than scoreC, then scoreC is greater than both scoreA and scoreB and Team C wins. If scoreB is greater than scoreA (the outer ELSE clause) and scoreC (the IF clause in the outer ELSE), then Team B wins. If scoreB is greater than scoreA but not greater than scoreC, then scoreC is greater than both scoreA and scoreB and Team C wins.

## Question 24
**Topic 2.1**: Binary Numbers

**Explanation** for Wrong Answer: B and D, incorrect. As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at an exponential rate, as the number of steps is equal to 2n for a list of size n. This indicates that the algorithm does not run in a reasonable amount of time.

**Explanation** for Correct Answer: A and D, correct. As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at a linear rate, as the number of steps is equal to 10n for a list of size n. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time.The number of steps for this algorithm is equal to the length of the list squared, as the number of steps is equal to n2 for a list of size n. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time.

# Confusing Problems

## Question 2
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/midtermquestion2.png)

I did not understand the purpose of the program and I had to try and guess what could be changed in order to find out the answer. On this question, I had to guess the answer because I did not know what would make sure the output of the code would stay the same.

## Question 16
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bigidea2question22.png)

This question was a complete guess because I had no idea what each one meant completely, I had an idea of each one, but I wasn't sure why the answer was selection, I knew it couldn't be iteration because that would help with the even number, and I had to guess between the other three choices, and I was right. I still do not understand but maybe I can understand by looking at someone else's test corrections.

## Question 30
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/midtermquestion30.png)

This question was very hard and I did not reallt understand what the question was asking and I had no idea what I had to do. I got this question right but I did not know why it was B and C, all I knew was that it was not A or D because the circles did not line up.

# Reflection on the Exam
Overall, the test was pretty easy and I am happy with ny score, but I should try to get a higher score. If I paid attention a little more, I think I could have understood the questions a bit more I think I went through this test pretty slowly because I did not really understand each question and I had to read it a lot of times. I think I can do well on the AP Exam if I find out what exactly I need to do and keep reviewing the content, spend less time on each problem.
