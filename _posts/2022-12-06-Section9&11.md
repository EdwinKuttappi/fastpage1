- Some conditional statements can be written as equivalent Boolean expressions
- Some Boolean expressions can be written as equivalent conditional statements
- Different algorithms can be developed or used to solve the same problem
- Algorithms can be created from an idea, either by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying existing algorithms
- Knowledge of existing algorithms can help in constructing new ones.
