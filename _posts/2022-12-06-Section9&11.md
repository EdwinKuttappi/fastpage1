## Notes
- Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks and this also means that the algorithms can appear similar yet yield different side effects or results
- Some conditional statements can be written as equivalent Boolean expressions
- Some Boolean expressions can be written as equivalent conditional statements
- Different algorithms can be developed or used to solve the same problem
- Algorithms can be created from an idea, either by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying existing algorithms
- Knowledge of existing algorithms can help in constructing new ones. Some existing algorithms include
    - Determining the maximum or minimum value of two or more numbers
    - Computing the sum or average of two or more numbers
    - Identifying if an integer is or is not evenly divisible by another integer
    - Determining a robot's path through a maze
- Using existing correct algorithms as building blocks for constructing another algorithm has benefits such as reducing development time, reduce testing, and simplifying the identification of errors
- For binary search algorithms
    - Determine the number of iterations required to find a value in a data set. 
    - Explain the requirements necessary to complete a binary search.
- The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of a sorted data set of numbers and eliminates half of the data; this process repeats until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated.
- Data must be in sorted order to use the binary search algorithm 
- A binary search is often more efficient than sequential/linear search when applied to sorted data
- There are two important ways to search a list
- **Sequential Search** 
    - It doesn't have to be in order 
    - For a Sequential Search you compare each number to the number you are searching for
    - You can also use this method for strings as well
- **Binary Search**
    - While using Binary Search you have to put the group of numbers from ascending or descending order
    - What the computer does it takes the lowest index and the highest index, adds them and then divides that value by 2
    - This gets the middle value and starts the search at the middle of the group
    - Go to the respective index and pull the element, if this is not the desired number then go to the left and the right to and repeat the same process for the left and the right without including the index of the middle number
    - To put the efficiency of the binary search method into context if you have a list of 600 numbers the maximum amount of attempts it will take to get the number is 10. (1 level of tree is one search, the algorithm goes to the side of which the number is on the tree)
    - This method also applies to strings as well because only the indexes are getting compared
    - As long as the user can put it in an order (preferably alphabetical order) to tell the algorithm which side of the middle index to go to next then it is possible to use 

## Vocab
- Iteration: Repeating steps, or instructions over and over again (this could be also often called a loop) 
- Selection: is a decision or question. At some point in an algorithm there may need to be a question because the algorithm has reached a step where one or more options are available
- Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer.

# Lesson Practice
Here are some notes that I took during the lesson as well as the practice problems

## Dice Problem
Do these two algorithms give the same results?

My Answer: No 

Explanation: The code is different and it will result in different outputs for specific answers, this is because the the indents are not correct and will run multiple for specific values. Take the number 5 for example, the first algorithm will give you an output of "Nice Roll!" while the second algorithm will actually output two lines, "Nice Roll!" and "Meh... You can do better". This is because there is nothing telling the code not to run the second line of code, because it is just if statements.
