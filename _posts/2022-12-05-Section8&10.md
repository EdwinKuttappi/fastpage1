## [Multiple Choice Quiz](https://pgk-lang.github.io/pgk/quiz)
 1. Complete the quiz and add screenshots of the questions you got wrong to your blog
   - Reflect on what you learned
   - If you got everything correct, look at the [javascript code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PGK-Lang/pgk/master/_pages/01_quiz.md) used to create the quiz and explain how the use of lists and iteration helps to make the code more efficient

### Corrections
I got Question #10 on the quiz because I wasn't exactly sure how many for loops we needed to use, but I knew that we needed to use a for loop because. There was 3 lists in the list, so I thought we could just use one for loop in order to iterate through. I believe that using one for loop would work but be less efficient, I think that by using 2 for loops it iterates through the lists much faster.

### Reflection
I felt like I knew everything from the quiz and could answer every question. I just had a little bit of a problem with Question 10. I was not sure how many loops are exactly needed to iterate through the lists efficiently. Overall, I felt that the quiz was pretty easy and everything that was in the quiz was covered during the lesson

### JavaScript Code
When I first clicked on the quiz, I was really impressed with the UI. I really liked the UI and liked that it looked so nice. I think whoever made this quiz did a really good job with the UI and made it really friendly to work with, and the other effects also impressed me. I thought that this would have taken a lot of code, but after clicking on it, I realized that was not the case. The code was way more simpler and shorter than I initially thought. I noticed that they just made a function for the questions and then used a for loop to display it making it a lot more easier than having to type out each question in each cell. The Lists and Iteration both help to simplify this code a lot, and it also makes it easier for anyone trying to understand what was going on, the code was not too overwhelming, so it was easy to understand.
