   - If you got everything correct, look at the [javascript code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PGK-Lang/pgk/master/_pages/01_quiz.md) used to create the quiz and explain how the use of lists and iteration helps to make the code more efficient

### Corrections
I got Question #10 on the quiz because I wasn't exactly sure how many for loops we needed to use, but I knew that we needed to use a for loop because. There was 3 lists in the list, so I thought we could just use one for loop in order to iterate through. I believe that using one for loop would work but be less efficient, I think that by using 2 for loops it iterates through the lists much faster.
