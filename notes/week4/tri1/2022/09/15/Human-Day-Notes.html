<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZizdB0TgAVM">Link to Psychology and the Good Life Talk</a></p>

<p>For Human Day, we were instructed to watch a video by Laurie Santos, a popular professor at Yale who talks about what we need to do in life and how to achieve it.</p>

<h2 id="vocabulary-from-the-video">
<a class="anchor" href="#vocabulary-from-the-video" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vocabulary from the Video</h2>

<strong>Stress</strong>: A State of Mental or Emotional Strain caused by situations</li>

<strong>Gratitude</strong>: Being Thankful and being ready to show appreciation and to be kind again</li>
  <li>
<strong>Affluence</strong>: Having a great deal of wealth</li>
  <li>
<strong>Intuitive</strong>: Using what one feels to be true without having reasoning</li>

<h2 id="notes-from-the-actual-video">
<a class="anchor" href="#notes-from-the-actual-video" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notes from the Actual Video</h2>
<ul>
  <li>As a professor at Yale, Laurie Santos saw that the Yale Students had a lot of stress and because of that they could not really make use of opportunities</li>
  <li>40% of College Students report more than the average level of stress</li>
  <li>1/3 of Students were so depressed that they could not do much</li>
  <li>Around 60% of students experience anxiety</li>
  <li>Over 50% of them feel lonely a lot of the time</li>
  <li>Over 80% of them feel overwhelmed with all they have to do</li>
  <li>About 1 out of 4 students at Yale took the class, and they were people who had a lot of stress and anxiety</li>
  <li>Whatever state you are in, you can improve it and control your emotions</li>
  <li>What people think are going to make them happy, they might not be happy</li>
  <li>Becoming happier takes a lot of work and requires a lot of work everyday</li>
  <li>People think things like Salary are important to happiness, but as you earn more money, you think you need more to enjoy</li>
  <li>Helping other people can really help to improve your happiness</li>
  <li>If you share what you are grateful for everyday, it can make your life much more happier</li>
  <li>Getting distracted can make you less happy, and people do not really pay much attention in what they are doing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-gratitude-list">
<a class="anchor" href="#my-gratitude-list" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Gratitude List</h2>
<ul>
  <li>My Church and the community because they are all very nice and they are all supportive</li>
  <li>I am grateful for attending Del Norte High School, which offers many courses and the staff present at the school are all very supportive and care about your success</li>
  <li>My Family and Friends who really push me to do my best and work hard as much as I can</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals-for-my-ap-computer-science-principles-class">
<a class="anchor" href="#goals-for-my-ap-computer-science-principles-class" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals for my AP Computer Science Principles Class</h2>
<p>I have learned that stress is a real problem and if you want to be truly happy, you have to put in a lot of work. I want to be happy in this class because right now, I feel it is a lot of work and I don’t know how to do it, and that everyone else knows what they are doing, and in order to be more happy in this class, I need to work more.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make assignments fun and try to code cool programs</li>
  <li>I can try to collaborate with my group more so I don’t have so much to do</li>
  <li>I can manage my time more</li>
  <li>Study the information and review it for the AP Exam</li>
  <li>Share tips with people and get ideas from them</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="plan-to-succeed-in-ap-computer-science-principles">
<a class="anchor" href="#plan-to-succeed-in-ap-computer-science-principles" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plan to Succeed in AP Computer Science Principles</h2>
<p>It has been established that the skills you learn in AP Computer Science Principles can be really useful towards many different careers. I really hope to learn as much as I can from this class so that in my future, I can continue developing these skills and use them for various actions.</p>

<p>One big thing that would be really helpful would be to update my Timebox each week so that way when it is time for the AP Exam, I can look at it and remember any important topics I need to study from that.</p>

<p>I also hope to do really well on the College Board Quizzes and try on them to see what I really need to go back and review. Another really helpful tool could be my team and I should communicate with them as much as I can so that way, if I have any questions I can ask them and get any help I need with understanding a concept</p>
