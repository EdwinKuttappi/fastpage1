<p>All Computer Innovations are built for a purpose. CRD - 2.A.1 says that the purpose of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression. CRD - 2.A.2 is an understanding of the purpose of a computing innovations provides developers with an improved ability to develop that computing innovation. CRD - 2.C.1 says that program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. CRD - 2.D.1 says that program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text. Also, CRD - 2.B.1 says that a program is a collection of program statements that perform s a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software.</p>

<p>Video 1:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are many computing innovations in the world that people use everyday</li>
  <li>There are so many things that people use everyday</li>
  <li>People use computing innovations all the time such as with online shopping and communication like email or smartphones</li>
  <li>Social Media allows people to communicate with others online</li>
  <li>E-Commerce is online shopping and helps you to save time and money because you can get products from your home</li>
  <li>Digital Assistant Devices are helpful because they can do things automatically, and it can help save energy and time</li>
</ul>

<p>Video 2:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Programs take input in different ways</li>
  <li>Inputs can usually affect what the output is</li>
  <li>Tactile means touch input</li>
  <li>Most programs are written in an event, which is activated when a specific action happens</li>
</ul>

<p>Video 3:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A program is a collection of statements, which is a single command</li>
  <li>A group of statements is called a code segment</li>
  <li>A program is often referred to as software</li>
  <li>Code Segments need to work for a variety of different lists, like lists that include numbers out of order, negative numbers, large numbers, or decimals</li>
  <li>Descriptions of programs should have comments and should say what it does to help others and yourself, it can explain why in detail it works</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#collegeboard-quiz-collaboration-quiz" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CollegeBoard Quiz: Collaboration Quiz</h2>
<p>I took the CollegeBoard quiz about Collaboration and out of the 6 questions, I got 4 of the questions right showing that I somewhat understand the topic and I can use what I learned to make collaborating with my group more efficient. I got question 4 and 6 wrong, but for question 4, I did not really look at one of the statements, so I think I should’ve have gotten that right, but for Question 6, I did not know how to read the code.

<h2 id="takeaways">
<a class="anchor" href="#takeaways" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Takeaways</h2>
<p>I have learned that are there are so many different functions when using a program and that can really help people in their daily lives. I also learned that there are many different types of input, and based on what your input is, the output can change, and events can happen based on actions. There are many different types of computing innovation in our lives, and I should try to innovate on any inventions to help people. An idea I have is helping to make autonomous vehicles more accessible to people.</p>
